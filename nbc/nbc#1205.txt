Chris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNN. Anchor Chris Cuomo has denied an allegation of sexual misconduct made against him following his firing from CNN.Cuomo, one of the network's star anchors, was the subject of an investigation, unrelated to the misconduct allegations, by the New York attorney general which concluded that Cuomo had helped his brother, former Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo, defend himself against sexual misconduct allegations. However, following Cuomo's termination from CNN, an allegation of sexual misconduct came to light. Following his termination on Saturday, Cuomo denied the sexual misconduct allegation that had this time been made against him. The allegation was first reported by The New York Times. "These apparently anonymous allegations are not true. To the extent that they were sent to CNN to negate what Chris Cuomo told his audience, he fully stands by his on-air statements about his connection to these issues, both professionally and in a profoundly personal way," a statement from Cuomo's representative Steven Goldberg reads."If the goal in making these false and unvetted accusations was to see Mr. Cuomo punished by CNN, that may explain his unwarranted termination." The allegations were submitted to CNN on Wednesday by attorney Debra S. Katz, who represents the unnamed accuser. Katz said on Saturday that her client is a former junior colleague of Cuomo and that the situation is unrelated to the former Governor of New York, the Times reported.The unnamed accuser came forward after hearing Cuomo’s on-air statements in response to the allegations made against his brother, in which Cuomo said he “always cared very deeply about these issues, and profoundly so. I just wanted to tell you that,” according to a statement from Katz.In that statement obtained by NBC News, Katz said when her client heard "the hypocrisy of Chris Cuomo’s on-air words and disgusted by his efforts to try to discredit these women, my client retained counsel to report his serious sexual misconduct against her to CNN." Katz said that CNN "acted promptly" after hearing the allegations and fired Cuomo. "My client came forward at this time because she felt in sharing her story and related documentation, she could help protect other women. She will continue to cooperate with CNN’s investigation into her allegations," Katz said.She added that her client had decided to stay anonymous due to the nature of her allegations.  CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment made by NBC News, but in a statement obtained by The Washington Post,  the network said it had “retained a respected law firm” and would  "investigate as appropriate.” RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveWorldWorldU.S. and other nations condemn Taliban over ‘summary killings’ of former security forcesAlthough Katz stated that CNN "acted promptly" after the allegations, the network said it already has "cause to terminate" due to Cuomo's conduct with his brother. However, "when new allegations came to us this week, we took them seriously, and saw no reason to delay taking immediate action.” It did not clarify what the specific allegations were, according to the Post.The Times reported that Katz also represents Charlotte Bennett, a former aide to Andrew Cuomo, who also made accusations of sexual harassment. In a statement made after his firing, Cuomo said that he was disappointed but "proud of the team at 'Cuomo Prime Time,'" his show on the network.  “This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did as CNN’s #1 show in the most competitive time slot,” he said.In a statement made by CNN after Cuomo was terminated, the network said: “Chris Cuomo was suspended earlier this week pending further evaluation of new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother’s defense. We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately.”The younger Cuomo, who has hosted “Cuomo Prime Time” since 2017, has previously said that advising his brother was a family matter and that it was appropriate because he was not directly reporting on the situation at the time.Documents released Monday revealed that Cuomo offered to help the former governor find out how many women were accusing him of sexual harassment.Andrew Cuomo, who was facing the possibility of impeachment, resigned in August.

A turbulent week of GOP infighting raises the stakes for the 2022 elections. WASHINGTON — Republican divisions spilled out on both sides of the Capitol last week, providing a glimpse into the dynamics of a potential GOP takeover of Congress with the party historically favored to make gains in the 2022 elections.In the House, acrimonious infighting revealed the extent to which far-right conspiracy theorists like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., feel empowered and expect to grow their influence if Republicans seize the majority.Meanwhile, a narrow group of GOP senators held up a major defense bill and nearly forced a government shutdown in pursuit of stopping vaccine mandates, providing a glimpse into the fresh governing challenges President Joe Biden would face if his party loses control.The week revealed the limits of Democrats' grip on power, despite the fact that they're in charge of the White House and Congress. Wafer-thin majorities have left them struggling to finalize Biden's economic and climate bill or smoothly process must-pass legislation.Democrats say a GOP-led Congress would empower rabble-rousers to engage in brinkmanship and create a safe space for far-right House members to push racist statements and election conspiracies."If Republicans take over, we will likely default on our debt, and face multiple government shutdowns every year. They will prepare to overturn the electoral college and further mainstream the incitement of violence," Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, told NBC News. "It’s extremely risky to put these people in charge — they will make Newt Gingrich look like a moderate. The Republican base is with Marjorie Taylor Green."The right-wing rebels may be a minority inside the GOP, but they demonstrate the problems House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell would face in corralling the party if they took control, respectively, in 13 months. The two met privately on Thursday.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said Republicans have to get control of the party, or they risk encouraging some in their ranks to create wedges within the party that play into Democrats' hands politically."We're up against deadlines. Individual members are exercising their privileged rights. And they're wedging. And as long as you encourage people to wedge, you're going to have more of it," Rounds said in an interview. "It's very unfortunate. Leadership needs to address it."Early last week, after Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., condemned Boebert's comments comparing Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., to a terrorist because of her Muslim faith, Greene chimed in to call Mace "trash." It sparked a bitter feud between the two lawmakers, with Mace using emojis to call Greene bat-shit crazy.McCarthy kept his distance from the clash, refusing to punish Boebert's racism or condemn Greene's attack on her colleague. The two first-term lawmakers are seen by other GOP colleagues as agents of chaos, but party leaders are hesitant of criticizing them as they seek to align with former President Donald Trump and boost his fabricated claims that widespread fraud decided the 2020 outcome.RecommendedPolitics NewsPolitics NewsBipartisan tributes pour in following death of Bob DoleU.S. newsU.S. newsBob Dole, WWII hero and former Republican presidential candidate, dies at 98McCarthy, wary of getting on Trump's bad side given the ex-president's clout with conservative voters, has been accused by critics of giving safe haven to racism and dangerous conspiracy theories in his bid to become Speaker of the House in 2023, should Republicans win control of the chamber.On Friday, McCarthy dismissed the prospect that the intra-caucus acrimony would compromise his ability to govern if he's Speaker."No. We're going to be quite fine," he said in response to a question from NBC News."If we are given the trust to be the majority, we will tackle inflation, we will secure our border, we will bring gasoline prices down and we'll focus on the economy," McCarthy said.Across the Capitol, a handful of right-leaning GOP senators were able to gum up the works on typically non-controversial issues last week. Objections from Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., torpedoed a vote to reauthorize the Pentagon. And a crusade against vaccine mandates by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pushed Congress near the brink of a shutdown.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer repeatedly blamed "Republican dysfunction" for the roadblocks. The difficulty in passing a stopgap bill without changes to government funding levels points to the difficulty of reaching a full-year appropriations deal by February."We ought to get out of shutdown politics all together, and it's something that a handful of people on their side insist on doing," said Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who faces re-election next fall. "We'd be a lot better with the Democrats in control."Adding to the elevated 2022 stakes, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a landmark case and indicated it is leaning toward gut Roe v. Wade. GOP victories in the midterm election could fuel the half-century-long conservative goal of restricting or outlawing abortion.Greene, for her part, attacked Mace "as pro-abort" because the South Carolina Republican supports exemptions for rape and incest. Mace replied to her on Twitter: "What I’m not is a religious bigot (or racist). You might want to try that over there in your little 'league.'"Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
U.S. and other nations condemn Taliban over ‘summary killings’ of former security forces. The U.S. and a host of other countries “are deeply concerned by reports of summary killings and enforced disappearances” of former members of Afghanistan’s security forces, they said in a joint statement Saturday.  “We underline that the alleged actions constitute serious human rights abuses and contradict the Taliban’s announced amnesty,” the statement said. “We call on the Taliban to effectively enforce the amnesty for former members of the Afghan security forces and former government officials to ensure that it is upheld across the country and throughout their ranks,” it added. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics The statement, released by 22 governments including those from the U.S., the European Union, Britain, Australia and Japan, as well as several other nations including, Germany and Ukraine, also called for quick and transparent investigations into reported abductions.  “Those responsible must be held accountable,” it said.  When the Taliban seized control of the country in August, the group announced a “general amnesty” and promised safety to all Afghans — including former soldiers and police.  But a report released Tuesday by Human Rights Watch documented the summary execution or abduction of 47 former members of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF). Military personnel, police, intelligence service members and paramilitary militia, who had surrendered to or were apprehended by Taliban forces between Aug. 15 and Oct. 31, were among those taken or killed, the report said.  Human Rights Watch said its report was based on a total of 67 interviews, including 40 in-person interviews conducted in Afghanistan's Ghazni, Helmand, Kunduz, and Kandahar provinces.Investigators spoke with witnesses and the families of victims, as well as former government and Taliban officials before drawing its conclusions, it added.  NBC News couldn’t independently verify the report's findings. Taliban fighters patrol in Kabul in August.Rahmat Gul / AP fileThe Taliban did not comment on the joint statement or the report from Human Rights Watch when approached by NBC News.

They had also been required to surrender weapons.   “The Taliban have used these screenings to detain and summarily execute or forcibly disappear individuals within days of their registration, leaving their bodies for their relatives or communities to find,” the report said.It added that in some provinces, local Taliban commanders had drawn up lists of people to be targeted. “The pattern of killings has sown terror throughout Afghanistan, as no one associated with the former government can feel secure they have escaped the threat of reprisal,” the report said. Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

Skeleton reveals secrets of ancient Roman town obliterated by volcanic eruption. The skeletal remains of a man whose flesh disintegrated in the heat from Mount Vesuvius almost 2,000 years ago has offered a new glimpse into one of history’s most famous volcanic eruptions.Archaeologists released pictures Wednesday of the skeleton found at the ancient site of Herculaneum — which along with Pompeii was utterly destroyed by the eruption in 79 A.D. — the first human remains to be found there in decades.The man, discovered in October and thought to be around 40 to 45 years old, was surrounded by carbonized wood. Preliminary work has also found traces of fabric and what appears to be a bag. Painstaking work is continuing to analyze the remains.The bones were tainted red, a mark of the stains left by the victim’s blood, Francesco Sirano, director of the Herculaneum Archaeological Park, told the Italian news agency ANSA.The site of archaeological excavations of the city of Herculaneum in Ercolano, Italy.Ivan Romano / Getty Images“It’s helped enormously to understand both the last moments of the site, but also the 100 years running up to it,” professor Andrew Wallace-Hadrill from the United Kingdom's Cambridge University and a former director of the Herculaneum Project which collaborates on the ongoing excavations, told NBC News.“The power of nature is absolutely awesome and to be under a volcanic eruption is just unimaginably violent. The site sits there peacefully in the sunshine and it seems so idyllic, and you have to explain to people that this has been through the most violent eruption.”Wallace-Hadrill said that a previous excavation cut off the feet of the skeleton.RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leave“Initially they found a couple of leg bones sticking out of the edge of the escarpment. And indeed the excavation through the escarpment had cut off the feet of this skeleton — a bit like finding a mafia killing,” he said.Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politicsThe victims' soft tissue was either vaporized in that heat or has decayed over centuries. In one case, researchers said the heat was enough to vitrify the brain of a body in Herculaneum, turning it into a hard glasslike substance, as the temperature reached 968 degrees Fahrenheit.Known as Ercolano in modern-day Italy and situated to the south of Naples, Herculaneum was a seaside town favored by wealthy Romans. In 1709, ancient remains were revealed during the digging of a well. Previous excavations in the 1980s and the 1990s exposed more than 300 skeletons there.Modern forensic techniques can reveal far more than previous generations of archaeologists could: Earlier this year, scientists said one skeleton found in the 1980s likely belonged to a Roman soldier sent on a doomed rescue mission to Pompeii and Herculaneum. “You feel that you are in immediate contact with ancient life, not the blurred contact you get from typical archaeological sites. Because the process of destruction is 24 hours, you have this extraordinary immediacy,” Wallace-Hadrill said.Pompeii and Herculaneum were situated in different directions from Vesuvius, meaning the effect of the eruption was different on both.Wallace-Hadrill added that many of the people killed by the eruption — their charred remains often show them cowering for shelter — could have survived had they left the area.“The wise ones, one realizes in retrospect, simply walked away from the eruption the moment it started,” he said. “If they’d all known this, they all could have escaped, they just had to walk away… But hundreds and thousands did not.”Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

Indonesia volcano death toll rises as search for missing continues. LUMAJANG, Indonesia — At least 13 people are dead and seven are missing after a deadly eruption of the highest volcano on Indonesia’s most densely populated island of Java, officials said Sunday.Mount Semeru in Lumajang district in East Java province spewed thick columns of ash more than 40,000 feet into the sky, and searing gas and lava flowed down its slopes after a sudden eruption Saturday triggered by heavy rains. Photos from the area showed several villages blanketed with thick ash. Television reports showed people screaming and running under a huge ash cloud, their faces wet from rain mixed with volcanic dust. The last time Semeru erupted, in January, there were no casualties.Ash covers houses and trees on the slopes of Mount Semeru in Lumajang on Sunday.Aman Rochman / AFP - Getty ImagesA thunderstorm and days of rain, which eroded and finally collapsed the lava dome atop the 12,060-foot Semeru, triggered the eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey center.He said flows of searing gas and lava traveled up to 2,600 feet to a nearby river at least twice on Saturday. People were advised to stay three miles from the crater’s mouth, the agency said.“Thick columns of ash have turned several villages to darkness,” said Lumajang district head Thoriqul Haq.

He's been called racist and dangerous, and he's running for president of France . PARIS — Éric Zemmour does not mind comparisons to Donald Trump. “We are not the same but we have points in common,” the far-right TV pundit, who Tuesday declared his candidacy for French president, told NBC News at a recent book signing outside Lyon. “He is very American and I am very French, almost to the point of being a caricature.” In fact, a central plank of his political vision echoes Trump’s “Make America Great Again” message: “I want a French France,” he has said. A woman walks past a poster of Éric Zemmour, a political pundit who has emerged as a new leader of the country’s formidable far right.Rafael Yaghobzadeh for NBC NewsSlight and charismatic Zemmour, whose parents were French Algerian Jews, may be very French, but the media frenzy surrounding him and his background as an outspoken star of the small screen is drawing parallels to the former American president’s meteoric rise. A recent video of Zemmour pointing a sniper rifle at journalists in Paris has been watched by millions. His controversial opinions on women and France’s role in World War II have shocked many.  But his leitmotif is immigration and Islam. “We will not let ourselves be dominated, subjugated, conquered, colonized,” he said in a video announcing his candidacy Tuesday.“We will not let ourselves be replaced,” he added, a nod to the “great replacement,” a conspiracy theory which posits that European, white and Christian populations are being supplanted by nonwhite immigrants from Africa and the Middle East, particularly Muslims. It has been adopted by white supremacists, and linked to mass shootings in the United States and New Zealand. Seemingly out of nowhere, Zemmour, 63, has electrified France’s presidential race. The neatly-dressed firebrand has hammered home warnings of a country in decline and exploited sentiments thriving well beyond its shores to emerge as a new leader of the country’s formidable far right, while still appealing to more mainstream conservative voters. More than one poll has predicted he could overtake Marine Le Pen, the doyen of the hard right, to reach the final round of the election in April and go head-to-head with President Emmanuel Macron.“I think people are not enough afraid of him — they don’t think he can make it,” said Gaspard Gantzer, a former strategy and communications adviser to the last Socialist president of France, François Hollande. “Nobody thought that Trump could win.”Modest beginningsZemmour spent much of his early childhood in Drancy, a modest Parisian suburb whose high-rise social housing and private apartment blocks dwarf the small detached properties set back behind iron railings below. Éric Zemmour grew up in the culturally and ethnically diverse Parisian suburb of Drancy. Rafael Yaghobzadeh for NBC NewsThe population of this sprawling suburb reflects the waves of immigration over the years, including those who arrived from southern Europe and former African colonies like Algeria. His parents, widely reported to be named Roger, an ambulance driver, and Lucette, a housewife, moved to France from Algeria in 1952. Storefronts tout everything from French patisserie to kebabs, the streets are clean if not beautiful, and the houses neatly kept. In one central bar, men congregate around a television checking the numbers they’ve drawn in a lotto-style game against those on the screen.The extent of Drancy’s diversity is difficult to grasp exactly because France’s commitment to universalism, which subsumes other identities into Frenchness and encourages immigrants to integrate, largely prohibits the government census from counting people by race or religion.It is this Frenchness that Zemmour wants to preserve, and what has led him to label Islam as “incompatible with France.” On a recent visit to his home suburb televised by TV channel CNews, he confronted a woman who was wearing a headscarf. “You’re not doing as the French do,” he told the woman, who was introduced as Rachida, a naturalized French citizen, and who had just insisted that she is French. “I work, I pay my taxes, I raise my children,” she responded. “See the woman that I am, not the piece of fabric on my head.” “I see only the fabric on your head, because you only show that … you say to everyone, ‘I’m Muslim,’” Zemmour responded.  “If he wins, the risk is civil war,” said Hamid Chabani, a deputy mayor of Drancy. Rafael Yaghobzadeh for NBC NewsHamid Chabani, a deputy mayor of Drancy and the founder of a Franco-Berber cultural center in the suburb, said Zemmour’s rhetoric was dangerous and risked emboldening the most extreme members of the Muslim community in France. The Berbers are an indigenous people of North Africa.“It’s Islamism that’s not compatible with France, it’s the terrorists who aren’t compatible with France,” he said in his office in Drancy’s municipal building, which is framed by a neat square complete with bright bedding plants and a fountain. “We have the right to have a religion.”“If he wins, the risk is civil war,” Chabani said, adding that he doubted Zemmour would win.France has one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe, a legacy of its colonial domination of large parts of Africa and the Middle East. In recent years, it has also been bloodied by deadly terrorist attacks, many of which were carried out by homegrown radical Islamists. Zemmour says he makes a distinction between Islam and Muslims and says everyone has the right to practice their religion. He says he has nothing against foreigners, but prefers French people, and asks that immigrants assimilate. He wants to oblige parents to give their children “French” names rather than foreign ones such as Kevin or Mohammed. He has warned repeatedly of the “great replacement,” an idea popularized by the French writer Renaud Camus.Asked by NBC News whether the “great replacement” was in fact a conspiracy theory, Zemmour demurred, describing it as an “unstoppable” demographic process. Some in Drancy believe he speaks cold hard truths even if they say he sometimes goes too far. Michelle Ardinge, a French citizen born in Madagascar who now runs a funeral home in the suburb, said she agreed with most of what Zemmour said on immigration.“We’re a cosmopolitan country, but still at home you shouldn’t feel invaded by foreigners who don’t respect anything,” she said.“It is necessary to refuse the language that the media imposes,” said Zemmour, seen here shaking hands with supporters as he arrives at a promotional event for his new book "France hasn't said its last word."Chesnot / Getty ImagesBut Zemmour’s controversial opinions have also landed him in hot water. Last month, he went on trial for inciting racial hatred for calling unaccompanied child migrants “thieves,” “killers” and “rapists” on TV last year.Zemmour said in a statement that the proceedings were nothing more than a further “intimidation attempt” and that he would not attend the trial because he believes political debate should not take place in courtrooms.His lawyer, Olivier Pardo, told RMC radio that the charges don’t hold up: “He’s wanted for ‘racial hatred,’ for inciting racial discrimination with regards to unaccompanied minors, but as far as I know, unaccompanied minors are neither a race, nor a nation, nor an ethnicity.”‘Immeasurable good luck’ While espousing Frenchness, Zemmour’s own roots come from further afield. He was born in Montreuil in the eastern suburbs of Paris; his parents had moved to metropolitan France from Algeria — a colony that gained its independence in 1962 after 132 years of French rule. Zemmour has said his parents “idolized” France and that he and his family, whose surname means olive tree in Berber, successfully assimilated to the French way of life. In his most recent book,  he writes that he always thought it “immeasurable good luck” to be able to become the compatriot of the likes of René Descartes and Gustave Flaubert. RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveHe has spoken about how growing up, he wore a skullcap in the synagogue but not on the street, and how his name was Éric outside and Moses inside the place of worship.As for his own beliefs, Zemmour has said he’s doubtful about the existence of God but that he goes to the synagogue when he wants to re-immerse himself in the rites of his childhood and to remember his parents. He has shocked many with his claims that France’s wartime Vichy regime, which teamed up with the country’s Nazi occupiers, “protected” French Jews while handing over foreign ones. Around 76,000 Jews are estimated to have been deported from France to the death camps during World War II. The majority went through a camp in Drancy, situated less than a mile from the modest apartment block where Zemmour grew up. Protesters hold a banner that reads "Marseille Anti-Fascist" during a visit to the city by French far-right media pundit Eric Zemmour.Christophe Simon / AFP via Getty ImagesToday, a somber sculpture of figures lying across one another, a symbolic rail carriage and a museum mark the site of what was then an antechamber to Auschwitz concentration camp. But it took time for France to reckon with this dark chapter in its history. In 1995, then-President Jacques Chirac acknowledged that France had “handed over those under its protection to their executioners,” finally owning up to the country’s role in the Vel d’Hiv round-up, a mass arrest of Jews by French police in 1942. France’s chief rabbi, Haïm Korsia, has described Zemmour as anti-Semitic and racist. In response, Zemmour accused Korsia of being a “court Jew” who wanted to deliver his scalp to Macron.  For Serge Klarsfeld, a historian and Nazi hunter, it is what Zemmour says about Muslims that is most alarming. “He speaks like Hitler,” Klarsfeld said. “He has a beastly vision of society and what he says is either it’s them or us.” Some blame the media for giving oxygen to Zemmour’s ideas. A recent poll found that 2 in 3 French people are concerned that a “great replacement” could happen in France. But Zemmour’s supporters say efforts to protect the French people and their interests do not make Zemmour  — or them — racist. As for the charge of anti-Semitism, they point to the fact that he is Jewish and say he will protect Jews against insults and attacks by Islamists. Press contacts around Zemmour did not respond or declined to field requests for comment regarding allegations that the TV pundit’s speech is racist, sexist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic, as well as clarification about his run-ins with the French justice system.Among his most vocal supporters is a group of young people, Génération Z, who have a strong online presence and are led by a cherub-faced president, Stanislas Rigault. Sitting on the terrasse of a Parisian cafe, the 22-year-old former law student described Zemmour as “the brains” of the French right and said he was the only person capable of synthesizing the working-class electorate of Le Pen, with those who usually vote for the conservative Les Republicains. “It’s those two electorates that could lead to victory in the end,” he added.Stanislas Rigault, President of Zemmour support group "Generation Z".Joel Saget / AFP via Getty ImagesRecent polls consistently put Macron ahead of right-wing candidates, but that hasn’t stopped supporters from throwing their weight behind Zemmour.    Other fans include a group of teachers who recently wrote an Op-Ed in a conservative daily in which they lamented the influence of “progressive propaganda” on schools and called for reform founded on “merit, excellence and authority” — a transformation they say only Zemmour has the courage to pull off. The authors believe standards in French schools are in decline, children are no longer taught to love their country, teachers no longer have enough authority, and ideology is seeping its way into the classroom, a spokesman for the teachers, Guillaume Bessières, said recently over coffee. “He wants to keep ideology away from the classroom,” Bessières said of Zemmour, adding that Zemmour differentiates between teaching and raising children. It’s up to parents to orientate children morally and politically, Bessières said. “When schools take charge of raising children, and even the ideology of children, for us it’s a danger,” he added. But for others, it is Zemmour himself who poses a threat. A recent poll found that he is the most rejected political personality in France, with 70 percent of eligible voters considering him “racist,” 66 percent “misogynist” and 67 percent considering him “dangerous.” Zemmour has denied being a misogynist or racist. Recent polls have also shown Le Pen to be Macron’s principal rival once again, overtaking Zemmour. Separately, on Friday, lawyers announced that Zemmour and one of his political aides, Sarah Knafo, would launch legal proceedings after Closer magazine claimed they were expecting a baby. But the polemicist won’t give up without a fight — and like Trump, one place that starts is by pushing back against the media. “It is necessary to refuse the language that the media imposes,” Zemmour said recently. “Trump does that in his own way and I do it in mine.”Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Ghislaine Maxwell's defense keeps 'spotlight' on Epstein, other powerful men. The British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is the one accused of sex trafficking, but during the first five days of testimony in a New York City courtroom her lawyers have put her deceased boss, Jeffrey Epstein, and his famous friends on trial, legal experts say.That strategy quickly became evident on the first day of the long-awaited trial when attorney Bobbi Sternheim, in her opening statement, dipped into the book of Genesis to defend Maxwell.“Ever since Eve was tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men,” Sternheim said. “She is not Jeffrey Epstein, she is not like Jeffrey Epstein.”In fact, Maxwell’s defense team is subtly trying to portray her as Epstein’s first victim, the experts said.Defense lawyer Bobbi Sternheim points toward Ghislaine Maxwell during a pretrial hearing Nov. 23. Jane Rosenberg / Reuters“In an effort to make Maxwell ‘Eve’ to Epstein’s ‘Adam,’ as her lawyer suggested in the opening statement, we can expect the defense to do whatever it can to keep the spotlight on his manipulative, grooming behavior,” said Deborah Tuerkheimer, a professor of law at Northwestern University, who served five years as an assistant district attorney in the New York County District Attorney’s Office.The defense is also keeping the spotlight on the powerful men who were in Epstein’s orbit, such as former President Donald Trump and Britain’s Prince Andrew, the experts said.“The defense has signaled its intention to make Epstein central to this trial,” Tuerkheimer said. “By portraying him as charismatic, well-connected, almost larger than life, her team may well be hoping to make Maxwell disappear into the background. Epstein’s star-studded life of fame and riches can grab the jury’s attention and focus, increasing the odds that Maxwell appears as a merely peripheral figure in the story.”Ghislaine Maxwell's accuser says Epstein introduced her to Trump at 14 years oldDec. 2, 202102:32Robert Sanders, a retired captain in the Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps and the head of the University of New Haven’s national security department, said the strategy Maxwell’s lawyers are following can be likened to a #MeToo defense.“The #MeToo movement is not over,” he said. “The defense is trying to make the point that Epstein and all these men were involved, but they are unavailable to be prosecuted, but we’ve got her.”Epstein, a convicted sex offender, hanged himself two years ago in a Manhattan jail while awaiting a sex trafficking trial.On Day Three of Maxwell's trial, another member of her legal team, Laura Menninger, brought up Trump, an Epstein neighbor who had partied at the financier’s Palm Beach, Florida, mansion.Menninger asked Jane — a pseudonym for the first of four women at this trial who have accused the 59-year-old Maxwell of “grooming” them when they were underage to have sex with Epstein and other powerful men — to confirm that she was driven by Epstein to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach to meet the future president when she was just 14.Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Cipriani Wall Street on March 15, 2005, in New York City. Patrick McMullan via Getty Images fileDuring her cross-examination of Jane, an actor by profession, Menninger did not press her for details about her meeting with Trump or allege he abused her in any way.Nor did she have to, California defense attorney Jesse Gessin said.“The strategy of cross-examining about famous names achieves several objectives for the defense,” he said. “First, Team Maxwell’s overarching theme is Ms. Maxwell is a scapegoat. The government’s failure to prosecute these individuals supports this central theme.”RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveAlso, Gessin said, “the defense must own as many undisputed facts as possible in its narrative in every case.”“With a matter as extensively covered in the media as this one, most, if not all, jurors know these names are associated with Epstein,” he said. “Ignoring or disavowing these names would be a technical blunder. “In fact, the first of the seven people who testified in the opening week of the Maxwell trial was Epstein’s longtime pilot, Larry Visoski. Jeffrey Epstein's former pilot testifies that he remembers specific alleged victims&nbsp;Nov. 30, 202102:22The flights on Epstein’s private planes became the focus of intense media scrutiny after it was discovered that Andrew, son of Queen Elizabeth II, and other boldfaced names such as former President Bill Clinton and lawyer Alan Dershowitz took trips on his planes. There are no allegations of trafficking against Clinton and Dershowitz.Visoski, in his testimony Tuesday, also mentioned that several other well-known men, such as the former astronaut and senator John Glenn, the actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, and the violinist Itzhak Perlman, flew on Epstein’s planes. He said Trump was a repeat flyer before he became president.“There was more than once, I believe,” he said. “I certainly remember President Trump but not anyone else associated with him.”Trump, who once called Epstein a “terrific guy,” has not responded to requests from NBC News for comment.Following Epstein’s 2019 arrest, Trump told reporters that he was “not a fan” of the disgraced financier.The four women Maxwell is accused of trafficking, mostly in the 1990s, have been assigned pseudonyms to protect their privacy. Jane’s ex-boyfriend, an actor who testified that she told him that Maxwell and Epstein seduced her at age 14, took the stand using the pseudonym Matt.Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to all six charges leveled against her.

'Magic dirt': How the internet fueled, and defeated, the pandemic's weirdest MLM. The social media posts started in May: photos and videos of smiling people, mostly women, drinking Mason jars of black liquid, slathering black paste on their faces and feet, or dipping babies and dogs in tubs of the black water. They tagged the posts #BOO and linked to a website that sold a product called Black Oxygen Organics.Black Oxygen Organics, or “BOO” for short, is difficult to classify. It was marketed as fulvic acid, a compound derived from decayed plants, that was dug up from an Ontario peat bog. The website of the Canadian company that sold it billed it as “the end product and smallest particle of the decomposition of ancient, organic matter.” Put more simply, the product is dirt — four-and-a-half ounces of it, sealed in a sleek black plastic baggie and sold for $110 plus shipping. Visitors to the Black Oxygen Organics website, recently taken offline, were greeted with a pair of white hands cradling cups of dirt like an offering. “A gift from the Ground,” it reads. “Drink it. Wear it. Bathe in it.” BOO, which “can be taken by anyone at any age, as well as animals,” according to the company, claims many benefits and uses, including improved brain function and heart health, and ridding the body of so-called toxins that include heavy metals, pesticides and parasites. By the end of the summer, online ads for BOO had made their way to millions of people within the internet subcultures that embrace fringe supplements, including the mixed martial arts community, anti-vaccine and Covid-denier groups, and finally more general alternative health and fake cure spaces. And people seemed to be buying; parts of TikTok and Instagram were flooded with #BOO posts. The businessman behind Black Oxygen Organics has been selling mud in various forms for 25 years now, but BOO sold in amounts that surprised even its own executives, according to videos of company meetings viewed by NBC News. The stars appeared aligned for it. A pandemic marked by unprecedented and politicized misinformation has spurred a revival in wonder cures. Well-connected Facebook groups of alternative health seekers and vaccine skeptics provided an audience and eager customer base for a new kind of medicine show. And the too-good-to-be-true testimonials posted to social media attracted a wave of direct sellers, many of them women dipping their toes into the often unprofitable world of multilevel marketing for the first time. But success came at a price. Canadian and U.S. health regulators have cracked down on BOO in recent months, initiating recalls and product holds at the border, respectively. And just as an online army of fans powered BOO’s success, an oppositional force of online skeptics threatened to shut it down. Just before Thanksgiving, the company announced in an email it was closing up shop for good. Sellers packed video calls mourning the death of their miracle cure, railing against executives who had taken their money and seemingly run, and wondering how they might recoup the thousands of dollars they paid for BOO that never arrived.The announcement was the apparent end of one of the most haltingly successful companies to ride a wave of interest in online and directly sold alternative medicines — immunity-boosting oils, supplements, herbs, elixirs and so-called superfoods that, despite widespread concerns over their efficacy and safety, make up a lightly regulated, multibillion-dollar industry. In a world where consumers flock to alternative health products, BOO seemed to provide an answer to the question: Just how far are people willing to dig to find their miracle cure? A social post from Black Oxygen Organics and a Facebook post from a fan of the "magic dirt."Obtained by NBC NewsWhat is BOO?Monica Wong first learned about BOO in May. The 39-year-old was scrolling Facebook from her home in Brentwood, California, and saw a Facebook ad that caught her eye: A woman in a bright green shirt emblazoned with a marijuana leaf holding a sign that read, “F--- Big Pharma!” alongside a kind of treatment that promised to “detox heavy metals.” Wong had been looking for such a product, for her boyfriend and herself, and while the price was steep, a little internet research convinced her that the health effects would be worth it. Wong clicked on the ad and bought some BOO. Wong said that for two months she dissolved a half-teaspoon of the black stuff in a glass of water and drank it every day. But unlike people in her new BOO Facebook group who posted miraculous testimonials of cured diseases, weight loss, clearer skin, whiter teeth, regrown hair, reclaimed energy, expelled worms and even changes in eye color (from brown to blue), Wong didn’t feel like any toxins were leaving her body. In fact, she started having stomach pains. “I can’t say it was the BOO for sure,” Wong said she remembers wondering as she went to the hospital for tests, “but wasn’t it supposed to heal my gut?”How the internet defeated multi-level marketing fad that sold bags of dirt for $110Dec. 3, 202103:29Wong quit taking BOO and told the head of her Facebook group, a higher-ranked seller who earned commission off Wong’s participation, about her new pains. When asked why she didn’t alert others, Wong said the group administrators, BOO sellers themselves, censored the comments to weed out anything negative. “They’d never let me post that,” she said. These online groups are filled with true believers, acolytes who call it “magic dirt.” They post that they are drinking, cooking, soaking, snorting and slathering BOO on their bodies and giving it to their families, children and pets. “Who would have thought drinking dirt would make me feel so so good?” one person in a 27,000-member private Facebook group posted, her face nuzzling a jar of black liquid. Another user posted a photo of a baby sitting in a bathtub of water colored a deep caramel. In the caption, she shared that the baby had contracted hand, foot and mouth disease — a virus that mainly affects children and causes painful sores. “Tiny is enjoying his Boo bath!” she wrote. “We’re happy to say our bottom feels happier and we’re in a better mood!”  Many such posts are dedicated to tactics for getting kids and loved ones to take BOO. “Boo brownies for the picky family,” one poster offered. Testimonials like these make up the majority of posts in dozens of Facebook groups, set up and overseen by BOO sellers, with hundreds of thousands of collective members, where BOO is heralded as a miracle drug. Teams of sellers in these private Facebook groups claim that, beyond cosmetic applications, BOO can cure everything from autism to cancer to Alzheimer’s disease. Conveniently in these times, BOO proponents say it also protects against and treats Covid-19, and can be used to “detox” the newly vaccinated, according to posts viewed by NBC News. None of the posters contacted by NBC News returned a request for comment. But there may be an incentive for the hyperbole. The MLM boomBlack Oxygen Organics products can’t be bought in stores. Instead, the pills and powders are sold by individuals, who theoretically profit not only off their sales but off those of others they recruit. It’s the type of top-down and widening profit-modeled business, known as multilevel marketing or MLM, that has led critics to label BOO and products like it pyramid schemes. Participation in MLMs boomed during the pandemic with 7.7 million Americans working for one in 2020, a 13 percent increase over the previous year, according to the Direct Selling Association, the trade and lobbying group for the MLM industry. Wellness products make up the majority of MLM products, and, as the Federal Trade Commission noted, some direct sellers took advantage of a rush toward so-called natural remedies during the pandemic to boost sales. More than 99 percent of MLM sellers lose money, according to the Consumer Awareness Institute, an industry watchdog group. But according to social media posts, BOO’s business was booming. In selfies and videos posted to Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, women lather BOO on their faces and soak their feet in sludge-filled pasta pots while, they claim, the money rolls in. Black Oxygen Organics’ compensation plan, like most MLMs, is convoluted. According to their company handbook, sellers, called “brand partners,” can earn income in two distinct ways: through retail commissions on bags of BOO they sell, and through recruiting other sellers, from which they earn additional commission and bonuses. The more recruits a seller brings in, the more quickly the seller rises in the ranks — there are 10 titles in the company, from brand partner to director to CEO, with compensation packages growing along the way.A common strategy for MLM participants, including BOO sellers, is to create Facebook groups to collaborate and attract new customers.“I earned $21,000 in bonuses in my first 5 weeks!” one post read. “I am a single mom, 1 income family, this business was the best decision!!!”Black Oxygen Organics’ vice president of business development, Ron Montaruli, described the craze in September, telling distributors on a Zoom call viewed by NBC News that the company had attracted 21,000 sellers and 38,000 new customers. Within the last six months, sales had rocketed from $200,000 a month to nearly $4 million, Montaruli said, referring to a chart that showed the same. (Attempts to reach Montaruli were unsuccessful.)Facts around the company’s actual income are as hazy as the mud it sells, but the secret to dealing dirt seems to be Facebook, where sellers have created dozens of individual groups that have attracted a hodgepodge of hundreds of thousands of members. The largest BOO Facebook groups, including one with over 97,000 members, are led mostly by MLM jumpers, the term for people who sell a range of MLM products. The groups have also attracted more general alternative health consumers, as well as people seemingly suffering from delusional parasitosis, a condition characterized by the misguided belief that one’s body is being overrun by parasites. Users in these groups mimic activity in anti-parasite internet groups by dosing according to phases of the moon and posting photos of dirty water from foot baths or human waste from toilets asking others to identify a mystery worm. Facebook did not respond to requests for comment on the BOO groups or whether their claims violated the company’s content policies.User testimonials about the Black Oxygen Organic dirt posted to social media.Obtained by NBC NewsIn the last several months, the groups have seen a rise in members from anti-vaccine and Covid-denial communities, including prominent activists who sell the product to raise funds for anti-vaccine efforts.A profile of one top seller featured in BOO’s semiregular glossy magazine, “The Bog,” noted that Covid had drawn more people to the industry. “It’s been kind of a blessing,” the seller said. While it undoubtedly attracted sales and built teams, Facebook also created a unique problem for Black Oxygen Organics: Those testimonials might have violated federal law that requires efficacy claims be substantiated by “competent and reliable scientific evidence.” They also attracted attention, not only from customers, but from health professionals, regulatory agencies and a group BOO executives have dubbed “the haters.” After a summer of unbridled success, the internet backlash began. The rise of MLMs online prompted criticism from some people who have created informal activist groups to bring awareness to what they say are the predatory practices of MLM companies and organized campaigns to disrupt specific businesses. Many of the groups use the same social media techniques to organize their responses.Online activists who oppose MLMs formed Facebook groups targeting BOO for its claims. Members of these groups infiltrated the BOO community, signing up as sellers, joining pro-BOO groups, and attending BOO sales meetings, then reporting back what they had seen to the group. They posted videos of the company meetings and screenshots from the private BOO sales groups and urged members to file official complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug Administration. YouTube creators made videos debunking BOO peddlers’ most outrageous claims, ridiculing BOO executives and making public recordings of the private company meetings. Ceara Manchester.Courtesy of Ceara ManchesterCeara Manchester, a stay-at-home mother in Pompano Beach, Florida, helps run one of the largest anti-BOO Facebook groups, “Boo is Woo.” Manchester, 34, has spent the last four years monitoring predatory MLMs — or “cults,” in her view — and posting to multiple social media accounts and groups dedicated to “exposing” Black Oxygen Organics.“The health claims, I had never seen them that bad,” Manchester said. “Just the sheer amount. Every single post was like, ‘cancer, Covid, diabetes, autism.’”“I don’t feel like people are stupid,” Manchester said of the people who purchased and even sold BOO. “I think that they’re desperate or vulnerable, or they’ve been preyed upon, and you get somebody to say, ‘Hey, I’ve got this product that cures everything.’ You know when you’re desperate like that you might listen.”The mudmanBlack Oxygen Organics is the brainchild of Marc Saint-Onge, a 59-year-old entrepreneur from Casselman, Ontario. Saint-Onge, BOO’s founder and CEO, did not respond to calls, texts, emails or direct messages.But decades of interviews in local press and more recently on social media offer some details about Saint-Onge, or, as he likes to be called, “the mudman.” Saint-Onge describes himself as an orthotherapist, naturopath, kinesitherapist, reiki master, holistic practitioner, herbalist and aromatherapist. As he said in a video posted to YouTube that has since been made private, his love of mud began as a child, chasing bullfrogs around Ontario bogs. Years later, he went on to practice orthotherapy, a kind of advanced massage technique, to treat pain. He said he packaged dirt from a local bog, branches and leaves included, in zip-lock baggies and gave them to his “patients,” who demanded the mud faster than he could scoop it. Saint-Onge said he was charged by Canadian authorities with practicing medicine without a license in 1989 and fined $20,000. “Then my clinic went underground,” he said on a recent podcast. He has sold mud in some form since the early 1990s. Health Canada, the government regulator responsible for public health, forced him to pull an early version of his mud product, then called the “Anti-Rheuma Bath,” according to a 1996 article in The Calgary Herald, because Saint-Onge marketed it to treat arthritis and rheumatism without any proof to substantiate the claims. Saint-Onge also claimed his mud could heal wounds, telling an Ottawa Citizen reporter in 2012 that his mud compress healed the leg of a man who had suffered an accident with a power saw, saving it from amputation. “The doctor said it was the antibiotics,” he said. “But we believe it was the mud.”In the ‘90s Saint-Onge began selling his mud bath under the “Golden Moor” label, which he did until he realized a dream, “a way to do a secret little extraction,” in his words, that would make the dirt dissolve in water. In 2015, with the founding of his company NuWTR, which would later turn into Black Oxygen Organics, Saint-Onge said he finally invented a dirt people could drink.In 2016, he began selling himself as a business coach, and his personal website boasted of his worth: “I sell mud in a bottle,” he wrote. “Let me teach you to sell anything.” The troublesIn September, Montaruli, BOO’s vice president, led a corporate call to address the Facebook groups and what he called “the compliance situation.” “Right now, it’s scary,” Montaruli said in a Zoom call posted publicly, referring to the outlandish claims made by some of BOO’s sellers. “In 21 years, I have never seen anything like this. Never.” RecommendedWorldWorldU.S. and other nations condemn Taliban over ‘summary killings’ of former security forcesU.S. newsU.S. newsBob Dole, WWII hero and former Republican presidential candidate, dies at 98“These outrageous claims, and I’m not even sure if outrageous is bad enough, are obviously attracting the haters, giving them more fuel for the fire, and potential government officials.” Montaruli called for “a reset,” telling BOO sellers to delete the pages and groups and start over again. One slide suggested alternatives for 14 popular BOO uses, including switching terms like ADHD to “trouble concentrating,” and “prevents heart attack” to “maintain a healthy cardiovascular system.”A common strategy for MLM participants, including BOO sellers, is to create Facebook groups to collaborate and attract new customers.Obtained by NBC NewsAnd so in September, the Facebook groups evolved — many went private, most changed their names from BOO to “fulvic acid,” and the pinned testimonials from customers claiming miracle cures were wiped clean, tweaked or edited to add a disclaimer absolving the company from any liability. But that wasn’t the end of the company’s troubles. While individual sellers navigated their new compliance waters, regulatory agencies cracked down. Days after Montaruli’s call, Health Canada announced a recall of Black Oxygen Organics tablets and powders, citing “potential health risks which may be higher for children, adolescents, and pregnant or breastfeeding women.” Further, the regulatory agency noted, “The products are being promoted in ways and for uses that have not been evaluated and authorized by Health Canada.”“Stop taking these products,” the announcement advised. Inventory for U.S. customers had already been hard to come by. In private groups, sellers claimed the product had sold out, but in the company-wide call, Montaruli confirmed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was holding its products at the border.Jeremy Kahn, an FDA spokesperson, declined to comment.Saint-Onge did not respond to requests for comment from NBC News. Phone messages and emails sent by a reporter to the company, its executives and its legal counsel were not returned. What’s in BOO?BOO is not the only dirt-like health supplement on the market. Consumers have the option of dozens of products — in drops, tablets, powders and pastes — that claim to provide the healing power of fulvic and humic acid.Fulvic and humic acids have been used in traditional and folk medicines for centuries, and do exhibit antibacterial qualities in large quantities. But there is little scientific evidence to support the kinds of claims made by BOO sellers, according to Brian Bennett, a professor of physics at Marquette University who has studied fulvic and humic acids as a biochemist.“I would say it’s snake oil,” Bennett said. “There is a lot of circumstantial evidence that a pharmaceutical based on the characteristics of this material might actually work, but I think eating handfuls of soil probably doesn’t.” Beyond the questions of the health benefits of fulvic acid, there’s the question of just what is in Black Oxygen Organics’ product. The company’s most recent certificate of analysis, a document meant to show what a product is made of and in what amounts, was posted by sellers this year. Reporting the product makeup as mostly fulvic acid and Vitamin C, the report comes from 2017 and doesn’t list a lab, or even a specific test. NBC News spoke to six environmental scientists, each of whom expressed skepticism at the quality of BOO’s certificate. Assuming the company-provided analysis was correct, two of the scientists confirmed that just two servings of BOO exceeded Health Canada’s daily limits for lead, and three servings — a dose recommended on the package — approached daily arsenic limits. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has no comparable daily guidelines.In an effort to verify BOO’s analysis, NBC News procured a bag and sent it to Nicholas Basta, a professor of soil and environmental science at Ohio State University.The BOO product was analyzed for the presence of heavy metals at Ohio State’s Trace Element Research Laboratory. Results from that test were similar to the company’s 2017 certificate, finding two doses per day exceeded Health Canada’s limit for lead, and three doses for daily arsenic amounts. Growing concern among BOO sellers about the product — precipitated by an anti-MLM activist who noticed on Google Earth that the bog that sourced BOO’s peat appeared to share a border with a landfill — pushed several to take matters into their own hands, sending bags of BOO to labs for testing.The results of three of these tests, viewed by NBC News and confirmed as seemingly reliable by two soil scientists at U.S. universities, again showed elevated levels of lead and arsenic. Those results are the backbone of a federal lawsuit seeking class action status filed in November in Georgia’s Northern District court. The complaint, filed on behalf of four Georgia residents who purchased BOO, claims that the company negligently sold a product with “dangerously high levels of toxic heavy metals,” which led to physical and economic harm. Black Oxygen Organics did not respond to requests for comment concerning the complaint. “The doctor said it was the antibiotics,” said Marc Saint-Onge, BOO’s founder and CEO. “But we believe it was the mud.”Obtained by NBC News‘A heavy heart’The lawsuit hit at an inopportune time, just as the company had “reformulated” its products and added a new label on the powder that now specifies the product is “not for human consumption.” “Things are starting to settle a little bit,” BOO executive Montaruli said in a video meeting explaining a change from tablet to capsules and a relabeling of the powder. The powder is “strictly for cosmetics,” Saint-Onge said on the call, a recording of which was shared with NBC News by an attendee. In the BOO groups, the company’s sellers were undeterred. “You can continue to use the powder as you choose in your own home,” the admin of one Facebook group wrote to members announcing the product update. “Know that it is the same powder.” “We cannot TECHNICALLY tell customers to use the product internally,” Adam Ringham, a “Royal Diamond CEO” (BOO’s highest seller title), told his group. “WE CAN HOWEVER — tell them that the powder is THE EXACT SAME as before … ”Ringham did not return requests for comment.Just as the BOO sellers were planning their Black Friday sales, the rug was pulled out from them again, this time, seemingly, for good. Two days before Thanksgiving, an email landed in the inboxes of BOO customers and sellers. “It is with a heavy heart that we must announce the immediate closing of Black Oxygen Organics,” it read. Details in the note were sparse, but Black Oxygen executives and employees offered an explanation in company Zoom meetings that afternoon. According to BOO President Carlo Garibaldi, they had weathered the FTC complaints, the FDA seizures, the Health Canada recalls and the online mob. But the “fatal blow” came when their online merchant dropped them as clients. With no actual product in stock for the last two months, sellers had been urging customers to “preorder” BOO. Now, the throng of customers responding to the nonconsumable “reformulation” by asking for their money back had spooked their payment processor.“This is our baby,” Garibaldi said, flashing his Black Oxygen elbow tattoo to the screen. “We needed this to go on forever.” Saint-Onge appeared briefly, holding his head in his hands. “This was my limit,” he said. Members of anti-BOO groups celebrated. “WE DID IT!!!!!!” Manchester, the group administrator, posted to the “Boo is Woo” Facebook group. “I hope this is proof positive that if the anti-MLM community bans together we can take these companies down. We won’t stop with just BOO. A new age of anti-MLM activism has just begun.”In a separate Zoom meeting unattended by executives and shared with NBC News, lower-rung sellers grappled with the sudden closure and the reality that they were out hundreds or thousands of dollars. “I am three weeks to a month away from having a baby and I’ve been depending on this money to arrive in my bank account,” one seller said through tears. “It’s the only income we have.”The future of BOO is uncertain. Tens of thousands of bags remain in warehouses, according to Black Oxygen executives. Sellers are unlikely to receive orders, refunds or commissions. The federal lawsuit will continue, Matt Wetherington, the Georgia lawyer behind the proposed class action lawsuit, said. But in the land of MLMs, failure is just another opportunity. Saint-Onge may have walked away from this cohort of customers, but for those who sold it, BOO was more than just a product; it was a way of believing. Now, the thousands of BOO acolytes still convening in BOO Facebook groups are funneling into a new Facebook group, named “The Solution,” and turning their outstretched hands toward a new direct-sales company, one that BOO’s top sellers claim offers an even purer fulvic acid product and a colloidal silver as well.“Thanks for all your continued support,” The Solution’s admins wrote in a welcome post. “Moving forward is all we can do.”Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Strip searches, trauma, isolation: Trans men describe life behind bars. By the time he ended up in the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on insurance and theft charges, Tahj Graham was 33 and had been living as a man for nearly half his life. Born in 1985 as the youngest of three kids, Graham soon realized he was not like other children who had been assigned female at birth. “As early as 5 years old, I knew that something was different,” Graham, 36, said in a phone call from his home in Mansfield, a suburb between Dallas and Fort Worth.He came out as a teenager, started taking hormones at 17 and had his breasts removed when he was 20 in a procedure known as “top surgery.” Once he had undergone a medical transition, Graham said, he passed completely as a man. “Unless it was someone that I was dating, I never disclosed being trans,” he said. As he was transitioning, Graham’s life also moved forward in other ways. He started working toward a college degree, taking classes at other schools before enrolling in the University of Texas at Austin in 2006. After he tried out a couple of other majors, he finally settled on religion. “I was given a Bible at age 7,” he said, and faith was “just something I always felt.”Tahj Graham with the Bible he kept with him at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice women's prison in Gatesville.Allison V. Smith for NBC NewsHe had dreams of starting his own ministry and distributing Bibles around the world. However, in 2016, Graham was arrested for insurance fraud and was also under investigation for wiring himself about $90,000 from an ex-girlfriend’s bank account without her permission. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to both charges and was sentenced to three years in prison.First, he was sent to a men’s prison — until, he alleges, guards started to perform invasive strip and cavity searches and he raised the alarm. “I was then transferred to a women’s unit, where the big nightmares occurred,” he wrote in an email. Over the next few months, he endured “voyeuristic strip searches by female staff,” was forced to grow out his hair and was sexually harassed by other prisoners, he said. “So many incidents occurred at the female unit I nearly lost count.”Currently and formerly incarcerated transgender people, like Graham, are increasingly coming forward to discuss their difficult experiences behind bars, and over the past few years, news outlets have devoted considerably more space to their stories. The reporting, however, has focused primarily on trans women, who are incarcerated at a higher rate than any other segment of the LGBTQ community. Transgender men are also incarcerated at disproportionate rates: According to the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, about 10 percent of trans men have spent time in jail or prison — approximately twice the rate of U.S. adults overall.Assault, retaliation and abuse: Life as a transgender woman in a men's prisonFeb. 26, 202006:20Incarcerated transgender men encounter many of the same issues as their transfeminine peers — including high rates of solitary confinement and sexual assault and denial of gender-affirming care and gender-appropriate clothing. But they also face “unique issues that are separate from what trans women experience,” said Aaron El Sabrout, the advocacy manager of Black and Pink, a nonprofit group based in Nebraska that supports LGBTQ people in prison. “Trans women have hypervisibility,” he said, whereas “trans men, most people think we don’t exist.”Trans men’s experiences, however, are not uniform. Every city, county and state, as well as the federal government, has broad authority to establish its own policies about the treatment of trans prisoners. For that reason, the conditions experienced by these men vary significantly across the country. Individual prison environments and leadership also affect what someone may experience behind bars.Verbal and physical harassmentIn March 2018, Graham turned himself in to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to begin serving his sentence. Although he had transitioned medically years before and “passed” as a man in his daily life, Graham did not fit neatly into the binary categories of “male” or “female,” and for that, he said, he paid. On his first day in custody at the men’s prison where he was first sent, two correctional officers began to strip search him inappropriately, he said. “The officer asked me to lie down on a table, then told me to spread my legs and hold them open,” Graham said, adding that he was then instructed to pull his genitalia back so the officer could “get a better look.” He said he could see that the officer was getting an erection. When the search was over, Graham said, he told a counselor at the facility what had happened. After an invasive exam at the nurse’s office, “they moved as fast as they could to get me out of there,” he said. Graham also filed a sexual abuse complaint about the incident, which, he said, was never pursued by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. (With Graham’s permission, NBC News requested a copy of Graham’s medical file and complaint history. The department denied the request; Graham was able to provide copies of several records he had.)After having spent several weeks at an Austin jail, Graham was transferred to a women’s prison run by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. But rather than offer him greater safety and security, the women’s prison “was a million times worse,” he said. Upon his arrival, Graham said, he underwent a strip search in view of a large group of incarcerated women. “They forced me to bend over and open up my legs to make sure I didn’t have a hidden penis,” he said. Graham recalled experiencing near-constant verbal abuse from staff members from then on. In a grievance form he filed while he was incarcerated, Graham described an incident in which an officer became enraged at him, screaming, “You were born a f------ girl, you’re at a woman unit.”  “I do not expect an officer to berate me and argue with me and declare as if they’re God in front of other offenders,” Graham wrote in the May 2019 complaint, according to a copy provided by Graham and reviewed by NBC News. Tahj Graham holds the Texas offender card he used for identification at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice women's prison in Gatesville.Allison V. Smith for NBC NewsIn its response, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice said there was “no evidence to support” Graham’s allegations and concluded, “No further action is warranted.” The department said it is unable to comment on Graham’s grievances because they are not public.Robert Hurst, a spokesman for the department, also declined to comment on Graham’s account of the strip search and directed NBC News to the department’s written policy regarding the Health Appraisal of Incoming Inmates. According to additional policy documents provided by Hurst, Texas Department of Criminal Justice officers are not required to refer to transgender people by their preferred pronouns.  Giovanni Gonzales, 31, is incarcerated at the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla, just north of Fresno. He said in a phone interview that he has dealt with transphobic harassment from prison staff members. In spring 2021, when Gonzales was working at the prison’s clothing exchange, his supervisor on the site — an employee of the facility — consistently made discriminatory remarks, he said. “He makes comments to me that are inappropriate. He always refers to me as a she. He refuses not to,” he said. In July, Gonzales said by email that he had been barred from going to work. He filed an official complaint, but his boss denied Gonzales’ account, and prison officials ultimately determined that his complaint was unsubstantiated, he said. “The cameras have no audio — how convenient for them — so all he had to say was no he didn’t disrespect me,” Gonzales wrote in an email.Terry Thornton, the deputy press secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, said that the department has a policy mandating respectful communication and that it has developed training specifically to help staff members better engage with incarcerated people who are transgender or nonbinary. “Repeatedly or intentionally using inappropriate pronouns or any other type of derogatory comments about a person’s gender is a violation under PREA, constitutes staff-on-offender sexual harassment, and subjects the staff member to discipline,” she said in an email, using the acronym for the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act.Gonzales, who grew up in San Jose, California, said his childhood was not easy. He knew he was different but did not have the language or the framework to pinpoint why. “I didn’t understand. I didn’t know about gender dysphoria,” he said.It was only once he was in prison that he started taking testosterone. “I had to wait a whole year to get on the shots, because I got in trouble a lot,” he said. “I wanted this so bad I got [myself] together.” Gonzales has now been on testosterone, also known simply as “T,” for five years.'Forced to be someone we are not'In addition to what he said was routine verbal and physical harassment from prison staff members, Graham also said he was prevented from dressing and grooming himself in a way that aligns with his gender. Correctional officers told Graham he would get written up unless he grew out his hair, and they forced him to shave his beard, which he had permission to maintain on religious grounds, he said. He also alleged that they told him he was required to wear women’s underwear and a bra, even though he had had his breasts removed.Tahj Graham at home in Mansfield, Texas, on Sunday.Allison V. Smith for NBC NewsSeveral other trans men incarcerated in Texas and contacted by NBC News said they had encountered officers who required them to wear sports bras and women’s underwear, as well as to grow out their hair to longer than 2½ inches or risk “catching a case” — getting written up for breaking the rules. According to advocates and currently and formerly incarcerated people, trans men in the state have no routine access to boxer shorts and are unable to buy chest binders, which are used by those who have not yet had top surgery to flatten their breasts. “I’ve tried to request boxers and chest binders and was denied, which made my depression worse,” Angel Ochoa, 49, another incarcerated trans man in the state, said in a letter. Asked to clarify the state’s position on clothing for transgender people, Hurst, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesperson, said, “Inmates are to dress according to the sex assigned to them at birth.”Ochoa said he was a tomboy growing up and started dressing as a boy when he was 12. His family supported his transition from the start, he said. “I was loved by my mom and grandmother and accepted as a boy.” Ochoa, who has been incarcerated since the 1990s, said he has faced humiliating and degrading treatment in the prison system. “The most pressing issue is us being forced to be someone we are not,” he said, adding that he was made to grow out his hair, which was shaved bald when he entered prison. “They say it’s a ‘security precaution.’ ... It’s just a way to hurt us.” According to data recently obtained through a public information request, 980 transgender women and 113 transgender men were in Texas Department of Criminal Justice custody in 2019. A policy document provided by the department states that “inmates are housed according to their genital status.”Nell Gaither is the president of the Trans Pride Initiative, a Texas-based nonprofit group founded in 2011 that has communicated with over a thousand transgender people incarcerated in the state. Gaither said it is her impression that in recent years the Texas Department of Criminal Justice has been less aggressive in forcing trans men to wear sports bras or grow out their hair but that it reflects a shift in priorities and culture rather than a change in policy. Facial hair continues to be a problem, she said, because trans men “can’t get enough razors to keep cleanshaven, then ‘get cases’ for having beards.” She also said that one significant impact of Covid-19 on trans prisoners has been the delay or lack of access to gender-affirming hormones.But the situation can vary significantly from state to state and even city to city. In California state prisons, for example, trans men in women’s prisons can buy the same hygiene items available to people in men’s prisons and are provided with male clothing. They can also purchase chest binders, though the $40 or $50 price tag puts the option out of reach for many individuals. In Georgia state prisons, trans men in women’s facilities can shave their heads and grow out their beards, but, except for boxers, they are only able to obtain clothing from the female order form.Ronnie Fuller, 42, is incarcerated at Georgia’s Arrendale State Prison in Alto, about an hour northeast of Atlanta. He said he has identified as male since he was a kid but did not always know what those feelings meant.“I didn’t know what ‘transgender’ was until I came to prison, and that was years within my sentence,” he said. Ronnie Fuller said he has identified as male since he was a kid but did not always know what those feelings meant.Courtesy Ronnie FullerFuller has been incarcerated since 2004, and for his first decade behind bars, the state refused to provide hormones to trans people who had not been prescribed them before they entered the prison system. In 2015, the policy changed. “When the option became available here in the prison, I jumped on the opportunity,” Fuller said of obtaining hormones.Since then, the prison administration has made other small concessions, including allowing trans men to buy boxers, he said. However, he and others are still unable to get chest binders, and he said the prison turned down an offer from a volunteer who was willing to donate them. Prison staff members “give us male hormones, boxers and believe that is enough,” he said, adding that being unable to obtain a chest binder and get gender-affirming surgery has affected him “emotionally, mentally and physically.”Fuller said that with so many barriers to obtaining gender-affirming care, he believes prison is the worst place to begin a medical transition. RecommendedOUT Pop CultureOUT Pop Culture'Harlem' star says show expands the vision of what's possible for Black queer womenOUT Pop CultureOUT Pop Culture'RuPaul's Drag Race' announces first straight male contestant“I have experienced more judgment and discrimination behind these walls than I have ever experienced on the outside,” he said in a letter. The Georgia Corrections Department did not respond to requests for comment made by phone and email.'It should not be so hard to get normal treatment'As a result of lawsuits successfully litigated across the country, most transgender prisoners in the U.S. now have the right to obtain gender-affirming hormones, regardless of whether they had been prescribed them before they were incarcerated. However, according to advocates, prisoners rights attorneys and currently and formerly incarcerated people, while the policies may exist on paper, hormones are often difficult to obtain in practice. Trans people behind bars said it can take months or even years for them to obtain gender dysphoria diagnoses and be evaluated by endocrinologists or other specialists, resulting in delays in treatment that are distressing and perplexing to those seeking care. Graham was in custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice for about six months before he was given access to the gender-affirming hormone treatments he had been receiving before his incarceration, according to Graham and prison records he provided. Fuller similarly said that while he was approved to be evaluated for hormone treatment in April 2017, it took well over a year for him to get his first endocrinologist appointment. “It should not be so hard to get normal treatment, whatever that may be,” Fuller wrote in a letter.Furthermore, while the U.S. has taken steps to ensure that trans prisoners have access to gender-affirming hormones, the vast majority of jurisdictions still do not allow incarcerated people meaningful access to gender-affirming surgery, said Danny Waxwing, an attorney at Disability Rights Washington, who has represented many trans prisoners in the state. For trans men, that means not being able to undergo top surgery for the duration of their sentences.Jason Yoakam is suing the Virginia Department of Corrections.Courtesy / Lambda LegalIn August, the LGBTQ civil rights group Lambda Legal sued the Virginia Corrections Department on behalf of an incarcerated transgender man, Jason Yoakam. The organization said the suit is among the first filed on behalf of an incarcerated trans man for the denial of treatment for gender dysphoria. “Under the Eighth Amendment, prison systems are required to provide adequate medical care,” said Richard Saenz, a senior attorney and criminal justice and police misconduct strategist at Lambda Legal. “This lawsuit is necessary because for a number of trans people behind bars, even those who are provided some care, [they] are often not provided adequate medical and mental health care.”“All medically necessary treatment is available,” a Corrections Department spokesperson told the Washington Post in August. “Treatment decisions are made on a case-by-case basis. In addition to medical treatment, individual and group therapy is also available. We follow the community standard of care.” The case is currently scheduled for mediation.A handful of states, including California and Washington, have policies that make it possible for trans people to obtain gender-affirming surgery while incarcerated. However, according to prisoners interviewed by NBC News, the process for evaluating who qualifies for the procedure is flawed and inadequate. Giovanni Gonzales, the California prisoner, said neither he nor his doctor has played a key role in determining whether he qualifies for top surgery on the grounds that it is medically necessary. Instead, the decision is made by a committee responsible for evaluating trans prisoners across the state, he said. Under Corrections Department policy, primary care providers on the institutional level are tasked with passing along requests for surgery to a statewide body known as the Gender Affirming Surgery Review Committee. The committee, which is made up of medical and mental health experts who have not treated the prisoner, then votes on whether to approve or deny the request. Gonzales and others interviewed by NBC News expressed frustration that the committee exists at all, since no parallel committee exists for individuals seeking to obtain treatment deemed medically necessary by their physicians — for example, people who need to have their breasts removed due to a cancer diagnosis. “My doctors don’t have a say in my surgery. It’s these doctors that go on this committee that don’t have nothing to do with me,” Gonzales said. With the support of his psychologist, Gonzales initially made a request to obtain surgery in November 2018. He was issued a denial several months later and filed a lawsuit afterwards alleging that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was violating his constitutional rights. In February, more than two years after he filed suit, his request for surgery was finally approved. No 'simple' housing solutionIn addition to facing barriers in obtaining their preferred clothing, as well as gender-affirming health care, incarcerated trans men also say they struggle when it comes to housing. As NBC News documented in an investigation last year, the vast majority of trans people in the U.S. are incarcerated in prisons that match their birth sexes or genitalia, rather than their gender identities, even though doing so without considering safety concerns or prisoners’ preferences is illegal under the Prison Rape Elimination Act. That reality has put many trans women in danger of sexual assault, violence and harassment.El Sabrout of Black and Pink said that transgender men would not necessarily be safer if they were housed in men’s facilities, as opposed to being housed according to their sex assigned at birth. However, he added, that does not mean they do not experience physical or sexual violence in women’s prisons. Graham said women on his unit would undress and climb into his bed at night saying they were going to have sex with him or would try to look at his body while he was showering, even though he was supposed to be permitted to shower alone. Prison staff members did not take steps to keep him safe, he said. After staff members were alerted to one particular incident, he spent about 10 days in “safekeeping,” a form of isolation also known as protective custody. Incarcerated trans people often end up in protective custody for their purported protection, because they are uniquely vulnerable to sexual and physical assault when they are in the general population. But the conditions in protective custody generally mirror the conditions faced by those in disciplinary isolation. When he was in safekeeping, Graham said, he was fed through a door and had very limited access to showers or his property. After a third time in safekeeping, Graham said, he was fed up and vowed never to end up there again.Tahj Graham at home in Mansfield, Texas, on Sunday.Allison V. Smith for NBC NewsTrans men may also be unfairly identified as threats to other inmates and punished, said El Sabrout, who said others “perceive them as threatening” and “dangerously sexual,” particularly when they begin taking testosterone. Ochoa said he was once placed in solitary confinement after he was accused of having a sexual relationship with a correctional officer.“Anyone can say anything about you and it’s believed, especially if you’re a trans guy,” said Ochoa, whose prison records were not independently reviewed by NBC News.When they were interviewed, most incarcerated trans men said they would not want to be transferred to a men’s prison. Some, including Graham, said they would prefer to be placed in transgender-specific housing units, an approach that was previously used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and some city jails to house trans women, while others said they would not feel comfortable in those environments. “Special units can cause you to feel isolated,” Ronnie Fuller, the trans man incarcerated in Georgia, wrote in a letter, adding that he “would feel like I am not being treated as a human but as an outcast.”El Sabrout said trans women and trans men may end up behind bars at disproportionate rates for broadly the same reasons — including discrimination, a heightened risk of interpersonal violence, homelessness and reliance on the survival economy. Yet because the issues they face on the inside are somewhat different, the solutions to improve their conditions may be different, too. In recent years, some advocates and legislators across the country have focused on passing legislation or changing prison rules to allow trans people to be housed according to their gender identities or in the facilities where they feel safest. Battles to enact such policies have been won in some states, including California and New Jersey, enabling trans women in all stages of transition to be transferred from men’s to women’s prisons. According to data provided by the California Corrections Department, 315 people housed in male institutions have requested to be housed in female institutions since the state began implementing its new policy, and 10 people housed in female institutions have requested to be housed in male institutions. None of the requests to transfer to men’s facilities has thus far been approved. “Some trans women have been successful at getting transferred to women’s prisons, and that improves their health outcomes,” said El Sabrout. “But there’s not quite so simple a solution for transmasculine people.”Minimizing harm, maximizing safetyWhile research on transgender men in prison is limited, currently and formerly incarcerated trans men and their advocates cite many of the same potential solutions to improve the experience of transmasculine people behind bars — whether they are in men’s or women’s prisons. The solutions include access to the same clothing, hygiene products and grooming standards as cisgender men; the availability of gender-affirming items, including chest binders; expanded access to gender-affirming health care, including hormones, surgery and mental health services. Relatively simple interventions, such as allowing trans people to participate in peer support groups, can also make a significant difference in their wellbeing, sources said. Waxwing, the attorney who works for Disability Rights Washington, said prison systems must ensure access to mental health and medical providers who are experienced and competent in caring for transgender people. If the expertise is not in-house, he said, prison administrators need to bring in providers from the community.   “Oftentimes working with community-based providers can be an important transitional step for agencies and minimize harm to trans patients as policy changes and training are implemented over time,” he said.  Waxwing also said not enough is being done to understand and implement changes that would enable trans men to be housed in men’s facilities.  “At the present moment, many trans men will be safer, and would prefer to remain, in facilities designated for women,” he said in an email. “What systems rarely, if ever, ask of trans individuals, though, is what they could be doing differently to address their safety and other needs such that being housed according to their gender identity could be a viable option.”Another important step, El Sabrout said, would be to make the Prison Rape Elimination Act substantively enforceable. Currently, states that fail to comply with the law risk forfeiting 5 percent of prison-related federal grants, a sum so small that its impact on corrections budgets is negligible. In addition to provisions regarding how to house trans people, the law also requires facilities to allow trans prisoners to shower privately and to limit when cavity and strip searches can be conducted and by whom. “Actually making PREA regulations and standards meaningful is really important,” he said.For Richard Saenz, the Lambda Legal attorney, keeping trans prisoners safe is not just about where they are housed but how they are housed. Prisons “have a constitutional duty to keep everyone in their custody safe and should implement policies that actually do that,” he said. “They shouldn’t rely on the use of ‘protective housing,’ where those restrictions are the same as solitary confinement and could cause additional harm to the person seeking help.”In addition, simply enacting official policies mandating that corrections staff members use transgender inmates’ preferred pronouns would improve their lives, he added. That is what he said his client, Jason Yoakam, is being denied at Virginia’s Fluvanna Correctional Center.“Departmental staff, with the exception of mental health staff providing treatment, are trained to refrain from using pronouns altogether,” Benjamin Jarvela, the Virginia Corrections Department’s deputy director of communications, said in an email. Asked about the Yoakam lawsuit, he said, “All inmates are provided access to the community standards of medical and mental health care, in keeping with the constitutional mandate to provide the necessary care.”'I won’t give up'For many incarcerated trans men, the battle to improve their conditions of confinement is ongoing.“I won’t give up and encourage others not to either,” Ochoa wrote in a letter. Other trans men have taken the fight for justice to a national stage. In the last national election cycle, Ronnie Fuller, who is serving a life sentence, launched a campaign to run for president. “I never thought about politics as a kid and nor did I ever hear my family talk about it,” he said. “It was not until I was in prison that I witnessed and experienced injustices and saw the turmoil in society that I started to speak out.”Since he was released in late 2019, Graham has been rebuilding his life. He is back in school, working toward completing his college degree, and he was recently promoted in his customer service role at a high-end retail company. But he said the 19 months he spent in prison is not quite behind him. Hearing the sound of keys jangling, he said, drives him into a panic. Tahj Graham with his girlfriend, Isha Williams, at home in Mansfield, Texas, on Sunday.Allison V. Smith for NBC News“I went into that prison sentence knowing I’d done something wrong,” he said. “My punishment was that sentence, and they inflicted a whole other level of trauma that wasn’t ordered.”Graham is also not as optimistic as some of the other currently and formerly incarcerated trans men about the possibility of change in the prison system — at least not in Texas. “It’s going to take time and attention and somebody giving a damn for the transgender population to be properly handled,” he said. “And that’s nobody” at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.Follow NBC Out on Twitter, Facebook & InstagramGet the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Majority of mumps cases are among the vaccinated, CDC finds. Mumps cases continue to circulate in the U.S., largely among vaccinated people, including children.Cases of mumps, once a common childhood illness, declined by more than 99 percent in the U.S. after a vaccine against the highly contagious respiratory infection was developed in 1967. Cases dropped to just 231 in 2003, down from more than 152,000 in 1968. But cases began climbing again in 2006, when 6,584 were reported, most of them in vaccinated people. According to the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one-third of mumps cases in the U.S. from 2007 to 2019 were reported in children and adolescents. As many as 94 percent of those who contracted the illness had been vaccinated.“Before that, large outbreaks of mumps among people who were fully vaccinated were not common, including among vaccinated children,” said Mariel Marlow, an epidemiologist at the CDC who led the new study. “But the disease symptoms are usually milder and complications are less frequent in vaccinated people.”Experts aren’t sure why vaccinated people get mumps, but multiple factors appear to be affecting immunity in vaccinated people, including a lack of prior exposure to the virus, waning immunity and the circulation of genotypes the vaccine doesn’t contain. The mumps virus is spread through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from the mouth, the nose or the throat of an infected person. An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, talking or sharing drinks or during close-contact activities, such as sports. Nearly 91 percent of the U.S. population has had at least one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine, which is administered between 12 months and 6 years and is 88 percent effective against the disease. Cases in recent years have largely been driven by big localized outbreaks, although a peak in 2016 and 2017 included more than 150 outbreaks reported in 37 states and Washington, D.C., amounting to about 9,000 cases. Mumps cases decreased last year compared to the previous six years, but the illness continued to circulate in the U.S. despite distancing, lockdowns and masking. From April 1, 2020, to the end of the year, 32 health departments reported 142 mumps cases.Disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in many children missing well-child visits and routinely recommended vaccines, including MMR, which could contribute to a future increase in cases or outbreaks.Mariel Marlow, CDC EpidemiologistThe numbers are still low, and they aren’t a reason to believe vaccines are no longer effective, said Joseph Lewnard, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley.“We’re talking about an infection that almost every kid in America would get before they were 20. Compared to the pre-vaccine era, kids who get the MMR vaccine remain extremely protected against mumps,” Lewnard said.Breakthrough casesIn some people, antibodies from mumps vaccination decrease over time, reducing protection. Lewnard said older adolescents are most at risk during outbreaks among young people because they are more likely than younger children to have reduced immunity due to waning vaccine protection. “Protection is still high, but there will be some who lose protection within a decade or less even after they are vaccinated,” he said. Marlow said most people aren’t routinely exposed to mumps, so there is also less immunologic boosting — when people are exposed to mumps that boosts their immunity but doesn’t make them sick. Because mumps has continued to circulate globally during the pandemic, she expects cases and outbreaks of mumps nationally that could be worsened by a bigger unvaccinated population to continue. “We know that disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in many children missing well-child visits and routinely recommended vaccines, including MMR, which could contribute to a future increase in cases or outbreaks,” she said.A third dose?Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the U.S. mumps vaccines contain genotype A strain, which no longer circulates in the U.S. But that doesn’t seem to make the vaccines less effective. “That’s one of the mysteries of understanding this is because when you give the genotype A vaccine during an outbreak, it still works,” he said. “We’ve seen that during outbreaks on college campuses, a third dose of MMR is enough to stop it.”RecommendedCoronavirusCoronavirusIs the best strategy against omicron to keep boosting with the original vaccine?CoronavirusCoronavirusPfizer could have vaccine data for kids under age 5 by year-end, CEO saysAdalja said combating new outbreaks may be as simple as shifting the MMR vaccine schedule from two to three doses. Adjusting the schedule is nothing new: The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices initially recommended a single dose of the mumps vaccine for routine use in 1977 and upped it to two doses in 1989. In 2017, the panel suggested that a third dose of the MMR vaccine may be given to people at high risk of catching mumps during large outbreaks.“Maybe we will need to update the vaccine to make it more tailored to the strain we’re seeing, but this might not be necessary. The current vaccine still works very well, and when it doesn’t work, a third dose does,” Adalja said.Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Still paying for antivirus software? Experts say you probably don't need it. Josh Brunty had spent more than a decade in cybersecurity — first as a digital forensics analyst for the West Virginia State Police, then as someone who taught the subject at Marshall University — when he discovered a shocking secret about his father, Butch.Butch Brunty was still paying money every year for third-party antivirus protection on his home computer, which his son felt hadn’t been necessary for most people for years.“He was talking about renewing his antivirus. I said, ‘Are you literally paying for antivirus?’” Brunty said. “I don’t know how he ended up doing it, but he ended up getting connected to Norton, spending, like, $60 a year.”Brunty’s father, like a lot of other people, hadn’t gotten the message that has become intuitive to many people who work in cybersecurity: There’s just no longer any reason for regular people to pay for antivirus software for their personal devices.It’s a shift that highlights not only how computer security has evolved in the past decade but also the way many people misunderstand the greatest threats to their computer security.Antivirus software still centers on its original use: looking for and mitigating software viruses. Because modern computer systems already do that, many programs now offer additional protections, like monitoring the dark web to see whether someone posts customers’ personal information, which experts find to be of little use.But the greatest threats most users face are no longer from viruses, particularly now that so much personal computing happens over the internet.Brunty said his dad also paid for a virtual private network, which routes a computer’s internet traffic through a third party. They were once considered vital to prevent nearby hackers from spying on online activity, but security experts now say that thanks to additional built-in security protections in most major browsers, virtual private networks are useful in only a handful of specific scenarios, like streaming video that is restricted in certain countries or getting around government censors like China’s “Great Firewall.”“He had no understanding of those two technologies, really,” Brunty said. “I think he just felt like if he spent the money, the investment of paying for it was going to protect him from everything.”Some antivirus programs can offer certain benefits, such as tools that help users avoid email-based phishing campaigns that steal sensitive login credentials. Others can help prevent identity theft.But most experts agree that the built-in antivirus protections on any major system — a fully updated Windows or Apple computer or an Android phone or iPhone — already protect against viruses just as well as the major programs people can pay for. It’s important, however, for users to keep their systems protected through automatic software updates offered by all major software providers.PatchworkIt wasn’t always that way. For much of Microsoft’s history, computer experts worried that Windows machines were susceptible to viruses, and there was no firm consensus about what third-party programs people needed to stay safe. But Microsoft Defender, the free and automatic antivirus program now built into Windows, has gotten so effective that it’s as good as anything customers can pay for, said Simon Edwards, the founder of SE Labs, a London-based company that compares and tests antivirus programs.“We test it regularly, and it’s one of the top products we’ve seen. It has improved a lot,” Edwards said. That doesn’t mean malicious software isn’t a threat. But newer devices tend to take care of most problems on their own. Hackers are constantly devising new ways to break into operating systems, and companies have to keep updating ways to stop them. Fortunately, the days of cybersecurity engineers’ writing patches for new, safer versions of software and just hoping users will update them is largely over.“It’s almost impossible these days to not have a fully patched Windows or Mac system, because they pretty much force updates,” Edwards said.RecommendedJustice DepartmentJustice DepartmentThe U.S. seized a record $1 billion of bitcoin a year ago. Its value has tripled.Social MediaSocial Media'A massive step forward': Inside Meta's plan to stop the spread of ‘revenge porn’While it’s a myth that Macs can’t get viruses, the myth is well-founded: Macs essentially had antivirus protections built into their operating systems from their early days. The same goes for iPhones and Android smartphones. The British government even tells its residents not to bother buying antivirus software for their phones, provided that they don’t needlessly endanger themselves by installing programs not vetted by an app store.Butch Brunty isn’t alone. A survey by Security.org, a cybersecurity advice website, estimated that nearly 45 million households pay for antivirus software. It also found that people are increasingly more likely to pay for antivirus software the older they are and that most have been using it for years. The dynamic has been observed in other parts of the technology world, such as people who continued to pay AOL for internet service even though they had other internet providers.McAfee, the once-ubiquitous Windows antivirus program, still has more than 20 million paying customers, a spokesperson said. More than half of the revenue the antivirus company Malwarebytes made last year came from personal users, a spokesperson for the company said. Other major antivirus companies, including Norton, ESET and Kaspersky, didn’t respond to emailed requests for such information.But trying to stay secure by relying on antivirus software misses the way hackers have evolved, said Bob Lord, who revamped the Democratic National Committee’s cybersecurity strategy for the 2018 and 2020 elections after the party was hacked by Russian intelligence in 2016.“When I look at all the personal account compromises I’ve seen over the past three years, I don’t think any of them were caused by malware,” Lord said. “They happened because the victims had poor password hygiene and didn’t have two-factor authentication on their accounts.”What to do insteadThe good news is that almost all of the tools everyone should be relying on to be more secure are free.Hackers today are most likely to target regular people by trying to take over their personal accounts for email, social media or financial websites. It’s easier to stop them when you know that their goal is “to impersonate you and take over an account you want to keep private,” said Harlo Holmes, the chief information security officer at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where she advises journalists around the world about the best ways to protect themselves from hackers.That means using unique passphrases — several words together, which are easier to remember than a string of random characters — because the longer a password is, the harder it is for an automated program to guess. People should also protect every important account with two-factor authentication. That lets users use their phones as a second way to prove their identities to websites, which gives hackers an additional hurdle if they’re trying to get into one of their accounts.Experts recommend using an app like Google Authenticator or Authy when you set up two-factor authentication, rather than through a text message, which dedicated hackers can intercept.Extra featuresSome for-purchase antivirus products come bundled with additional benefits that address more modern concerns, like monitoring whether customers’ passwords have been included in a giant dump of stolen credentials or telling them whether criminals are sharing their personal information on the dark web.But most of the services either do little or are available elsewhere for free, said Susan Grant, the director of consumer protection and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit group that serves as an umbrella organization for consumer advocacy groups.“There’s a limit to what that type of service actually provides,” Grant said. “They don’t prevent you from becoming an identity theft victim. They can’t prevent your information from ending up on the dark web, and they can’t remove it. They can just alert you.”The website Have I Been Pwned lets everyone check which of their accounts and passwords have been stolen and traded. The Federal Trade Commission offers a free guide for people who have had their identities stolen, as does the nonprofit Identity Theft Resource Center.“It may make people feel better to pay for such a service,” Grant said. But “the advice that you get is available from other sources for nothing.”Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Barbados cuts ties with Queen Elizabeth II, becomes a republic in a dazzling ceremony. LONDON — Almost 400 years after the first English ship arrived on its golden shores, the former British colony of Barbados woke up Tuesday as a republic.The tiny Caribbean nation removed Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state in a spectacular ceremony that began late Monday, breaking its ties with the British royal family — and with it, one of the island’s last remaining imperial bonds to the United Kingdom. The event was held 55 years to the day since Barbados gained full independence but kept the monarch in the ceremonial role. At the strike of midnight local time, the new republic was born to the cheers of local crowds. The moment was marked by a 21-gun salute and the playing of the Barbadian national anthem.A dazzling display of fireworks, dance and music was followed by  Prime Minister Mia Mottley declaring the singer Rihanna — a Barbadian native, as well as a global star — a national hero."May you continue to shine like a diamond,” the prime minister told Rihanna during the ceremony as they both laughed. Toby Melville / Pool via ReutersSandra Mason, a Barbadian who had served as the island’s governor general — or queen’s representative — was sworn in as the country’s first president. She was elected to the figurehead post by Parliament last month, but Mottley will continue to run the country.  “It is a monumental step,” Kristina Hinds, a senior lecturer in political science at the University of the West Indies in eastern Barbados, said on a Zoom call from her home in Wanstead, north of the capital, Bridgetown ahead of the ceremony. “I think it is part of the evolution of our independence, and it is certainly long overdue.”Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, was in attendance as Barbados celebrated ending its formal links with his 95-year-old mother. Elizabeth is queen of 15 other realms including the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Jamaica.Charles gave a speech saying the creation of the republic "offers a new beginning,” while his mother sent the island her "warmest good wishes" in a statement.“From the darkest days of our past and the appalling atrocity of slavery which forever stains our history, people of this island forged their path with extraordinary fortitude,” he saidHis presence may signal the royal family’s desire to maintain strong bonds with the island, which will remain in the Commonwealth — a voluntary association of 54 states that includes many former British colonies and which the queen has championed throughout her life. Prince Charles' speech sought to highlight the continuing friendship of the two nations in spite of Barbados' move to become a republic.ReutersBut to Hinds, Charles’ presence is symbolically “a bit odd.” “It’s problematic for those among us who believe that the British monarchy, as important as it has been for Barbados historically in positive ways, has also caused serious harm to the country,” she said.In the 17th century, Barbados was claimed by the British and turned into a lucrative colony using the labor of hundreds of thousands of people brought over as slaves from Africa.It became a major hub for the production of sugar, an increasingly crucial commodity that helped enrich British slave owners. “A result of the desire for the production of sugar, which was catering for a growing sweet tooth back in England — white consumer lifestyles built on the back of black exploitation and slave labor,” said Christopher Prior, associate professor in colonial and postcolonial history at U.K.’s University of Southampton. The island’s present day population of about 287,000 is comprised  mostly of the descendants of people brought over as slaves from Africa to work in the plantations. 'Not personal'Despite this history, there remains a level of respect for the monarchy and Britain in general, especially among the island’s older population, Hinds said. Many places in Barbados are named after the queen or her ancestors, and a lion’s share of the country’s tourists come from the U.K., she added. The island is often referred to as “little England.”Still, several people in Barbados welcomed their country’s move to sever ties with its old imperial rulers. “For Barbadians, this is not something personal against the queen, it is about our national pride and governance,” René Holder-McClean-Ramirez, 45, an LGBTQ community advocate and consultant, said on the phone from his home in Bridgetown. “As we grow and develop as an independent nation, having a foreign head of state just is not necessary or practical,” he said. For Ronnie Yearwood, an attorney from Bridgetown, the positive feeling of the move is combined with regret that the government pushed ahead without consulting the public on the type of republic they would want.Barbados first pursued the idea of republicanism in the late 1970s and in 2008 proposed to hold a referendum on the issue, but the date was pushed back indefinitely. The decision to remove the queen as head of state was announced in 2020 but with little consultation about the transition, Yearwood said. “There is a lot of disappointment,” Yearwood, 42, said. “It could have been a beautiful moment for all Barbadians.”NBC News reached out to both the prime minister’s office and Mason, but was not granted interviews. Archive footage of Queen Elizabeth's tours as Barbados removes her as the head of stateNov. 26, 202100:54'Global conversation'Barbados’ decision to ditch the queen follows a wave of protests across the world inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. A more forthright evaluation of Britain’s imperial past has helped drive an effort to bring down symbols of racism and colonialism from Cambridge to the Caribbean.“It’s a local manifestation of a very global conversation that’s being had about the legacy of the British empire and its colonial exploitation,” Prior said.“Barbados’ move is another element of our decolonizing moments.” So could the change stirring on the beaches of Barbados mark the start of a wave of realms cutting ties with the royal family?“When the queen eventually passes away, there is going to be an emergence of further conversations, particularly in places like Australia, about whether they want to have Charles as their head of state,” Prior said. “I don’t want to suggest there’s any inevitability, but I think it’s extremely likely that the issue of republicanism is not going to be going away anytime soon.”Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Why scientists — and much of the world — reacted so quickly to the omicron variant. When Jeremy Kamil got his first look at B.1.1.529, the coronavirus variant that would soon be named omicron, it didn’t take long to see the differences.More than 30 mutations made the variant's spike proteins, which cover the outside of the virus and are the main targets of vaccines and the body’s immune responses, different from those of the virus that first emerged in late 2019.“The number of changes blew people’s minds,” said Kamil, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport.The World Health Organization has identified and tracked more than 20 variants. Yet unlike with others that popped up around the world before they mostly fizzled out (including the lambda variant, which was first documented in December in Peru, or the mu variant, which was detected a month later in Colombia), there were early signs that the omicron variant’s cocktail of mutations made it different and worthy of swift action — even overreaction — experts say.While it’s too soon to know what the mutations mean for the effectiveness of vaccines or how sick people could become from the variant, the emergence of the omicron strain also highlights the frustrating reality of the Covid pandemic: Variants will continue to pose serious threats until countries around the world have more equal and ready access to vaccines, experts say.“It’s definitely sobering,” Kamil said. “It’s an exaggeration to say we’re back at square one, but this is not a good development.”Within hours of the WHO’s designating omicron a “variant of concern” Friday, dozens of countries imposed new travel bans, places that had loosened restrictions reintroduced mask mandates, and anxieties ran high.Moderna prepared to reformulate vaccine for omicron, if neededNov. 29, 202105:02It was the kind of quick and intense development reminiscent of early stages of the pandemic, prompting some concern that governments were overreacting before enough about the omicron variant was known.“It’s partly why people started facetiously calling these things ‘scariants,’” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease doctor and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.But even before it was given the “omicron” designation, the variant quickly gained attention among Covid researchers.South Africa was the first to report clusters of cases involving the omicron variant last week. Days before, data about the newly identified variant had also been uploaded to GISAID, an online database for disease variants, by a research team in Hong Kong, followed by more early sequences from scientists in Botswana.The number of mutations observed with the omicron variant hasn’t previously been seen with other strains, Adalja said. There are concerns that specific mutations to the spike protein could make the omicron variant less vulnerable to the so-called neutralizing antibodies generated by vaccines or natural immunity from previous Covid-19 infections."There's a very good chance this variant will be very resistant to neutralizing antibodies, but we can't yet say with any degree of certainty how resistant," said Theodora Hatziioannou, a virologist at Rockefeller University in New York City.Researchers have been preparing for this possibility.In lab experiments with a virus that was genetically altered so it didn’t pose a threat to humans, Hatziioannou and her colleagues produced myriad combinations of spike protein mutations and tested how well they were able to evade Covid-19 antibodies. RecommendedScience NewsScience NewsIsland turns into open-air lab for tech-savvy volcanologistsEnvironmentEnvironmentAn 'island has emerged': Coastal species discovered thriving on Great Pacific Garbage Patch, scientists sayOne of their more worrisome outcomes was observed in a lab-produced spike protein that carried 20 mutations — more than had been observed in any other known variant at the time but fewer than in the omicron variant. It was largely resistant to neutralizing antibodies from both vaccines and natural immunity.More research is needed to understand how the omicron variant behaves in real-world settings, but Hatziioannou said many of the variant's mutations correspond to the types of changes she and her colleagues studied in the lab."Nature essentially reproduced our experiment, only at a much larger scale," she said.Scientists around the world are racing to characterize the omicron variant, focusing in particular on whether it is more contagious, causes more severe disease or can evade the protection of vaccines. Those open questions may awaken anxieties from early in the pandemic, but Carl Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington, said drug therapies and the vaccines still offer crucial advantages."We have a whole bunch of tools now that we didn't have before," he said. "But it's disappointing, for sure. There was kind of this general feeling that we're coming off this delta wave, we're triple-boosted, and it could almost be like 2019 again."Adalja said the emergence of the omicron variant should spur people to get vaccinated or to get booster shots. Countries should also increase testing for Covid-19 to track where — and how quickly — the variant is spreading. Since omicron was designated a "variant of concern," more than 40 countries have banned travel from southern Africa.Hatziioannou said such sweeping measures, which may have been a "knee jerk reaction" to the most recent devastating wave of delta infections, are largely ineffective."The variant is likely already here," she said. "Closing the barn door after the horses have bolted is useless."Cases involving the omicron variant have been detected in at least 16 countries. The variant hasn’t yet been confirmed in the U.S., but the country’s leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it's possible that the omicron variant is already spreading in the country."When you have a virus like this, it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over,” he said Saturday on NBC’s “Weekend TODAY."President Joe Biden, who said Monday that people should get fully vaccinated or get booster shots, tried to allay fears about the threat of the new strain."The variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic," he said.Kamil similarly said it's too early to know what impact the omicron variant may have in the U.S. and around the world. He added, however, that it underscores the importance of vaccine equity and the need for wealthy countries to help provide that access."A booster shot in America has a far smaller effect of preventing variants than the first dose that someone gets in Chad or Benin or Togo," he said. "If we do not protect other nations, we are all going to sink together."Get the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
'Harlem' star says show expands the vision of what's possible for Black queer women. After earning her master's degree in fine arts from the American Conservatory Theater in 2019, Jerrie Johnson decided to move from San Francisco to Los Angeles with one goal in mind: to book a series regular role on a major TV show within the next six months.But after undergoing a four-month dry spell that left her feeling enervated and nearly drained her finances, she received two auditions that would ultimately turn her luck around in the City of Angels. The first was for a multi-episode arc on the hit Freeform drama “Good Trouble,” and the second was for a lead role in “Harlem,” a new comedy series that premieres Friday on Amazon Prime Video.Created by Tracy Oliver (“Girls Trip,” “First Wives Club”), “Harlem” follows the lives of four stylish and ambitious best friends who met at New York University and who are now forced to navigate the trials and tribulations of their personal and professional lives while living in the mecca of Black culture in America. Johnson plays Tye, a successful, queer dating app creator who prefers keeping vulnerability at arm’s length, causing her to date women who might not always match up with her intellectually.“I think there is something to be said about being a Black person/being a Black woman/being a Black queer woman in any male-dominated field — especially a white, male-dominated field — where you have to kind of shed away layers of yourself in order to get the job done,” Johnson told NBC News. “Women aren’t allowed to be emotional in male-dominated spaces, because then they’re ‘unstable.’ We see it in politics all the time.”From the moment that she received the audition material for Tye, Johnson understood her character’s desire to carve out a place for herself in the tech industry, to the point where she has neglected other parts of her life. “Throughout the series, things start to happen to her where she has to address it. She can no longer ignore that vulnerability and sensitivity that she needs to embrace in order to really hone in on the fullness of herself,” she said. “Throughout the season, we start to see these little tidbits of her health issues, and in episode eight, it just collapses on her, and she has to address those things, because she’s literally lying in a hospital bed and can’t get up,” “Usually, in life, when people are very headstrong about something and they’re ignoring other things, it comes out in health,” Johnson added. “Our health will always reflect what we’re not addressing.”Cast members and producers of the Amazon show "Harlem" attend a premiere on Dec. 1, 2021, in New York.Monica Schipper / Getty Images for Amazon StudiosFollowing the success of “Insecure” and “Run the World,” “Harlem” is part of a new wave of shows that delve into the complexities of Black women. The four lead characters — a tech entrepreneur, an anthropology professor, an aspiring fashion designer with a trust fund, and a vivacious singer and actress — are unabashedly ambitious, openly sexual and willing to admit that they don’t have their lives all figured out in their early 30s. It’s one of the many things that appealed to Johnson and her co-stars about this project, making for a fruitful collaboration on both sides of the camera.“For Tye, I had a lot of those conversations with the costume designer, Deidra [Elizabeth Govan], who is amazing, who didn’t want Tye to be any stereotypical butch lesbian that you see, because we want to push the conversation forward,” Johnson explained. “Not only do we want to show real reflections of nuanced Black women, but also to elevate the conversation. There is no such thing as a Black queer woman who owns a tech company in America right now, so that is a new thing that we’re seeing,” she said about the show.As a Black queer woman, Johnson said, she has always seen the world through a variety of lenses and intimately knows what it feels like to not be seen and represented in mainstream entertainment. “And because of that, I yearn for reflections of that on screen, where someone is living truthfully and authentically in who they are but also has this heightened awareness of where they come from and what they’re navigating,” she said. “I just feel like my 11-year-old self didn’t have a lot of that, especially being from North Philly, where there’s not a lot of representation there, there’s not a lot of access there, and sometimes there’s not a lot of resources.”The flip side, however, means it “forces people to be so creative,” Johnson said. “I’m always speaking to those people who are from where I’m from, who want to see people like them, who want to hear people who sound like them, and that is so, so, so important to me — just so we can expand people’s visions of what’s possible,” she added. “Tye is expanding people’s visions of what is possible for a Black queer woman, and that’s the kind of characters that I want to play.”Tracy Oliver attends the premiere of "Harlem" on Dec. 1, 2021, in New York.Hatnim Lee / WireImageMaintaining that high level of authentic representation didn’t only stop with Tye’s aspirational professional pursuits, but it also extended to her rocky personal life, as she navigates the queer dating scene in the Big Apple. Given that the show began production in early 2020, Johnson filmed multiple sex scenes before the Covid-19 pandemic and worked closely with intimacy coordinators who “were always asking questions” to make sure she was comfortable. “I always felt a part of the process; I never felt like somebody’s making me do something or I don’t have a voice in what’s happening,” she said. “But what was important to me is also seeing an authentic representation of queer intimacy that’s not for the male gaze. We’re not trying to be sexy, we’re not trying to be cute, we’re trying to be real, and I was constantly having those conversations with the intimacy coordinator as well.”Johnson said those conversations included asking, “How can we make this an authentic experience? How can we show queer women intimacy outside of the realms of what we’ve seen before?”RecommendedOUT NewsOUT NewsTransgender men describe 'nightmares' of being incarcerated in a women's prisonOUT Pop CultureOUT Pop Culture'RuPaul's Drag Race' announces first straight male contestantWhile “Harlem” chronicles the evolution of four unique women across different industries, the show is anchored by the dynamic of the main ensemble, highlighting the power and importance of Black female friendships. In what she can best describe as “love at first sight,” Johnson said she felt an instant kinship with her three co-leads — Meagan Good, Grace Byers and Shoniqua Shandai — because “these women feel like people I know in my life. They’re authentic women, and they have a sense of themselves.”And while “ego and a little bit of insecurity can get in the way” in a competitive business that is used to pitting Black women against one another for a limited number of coveted roles, Johnson “never felt that with any of these women,” no matter how long their resumes were. “It was always camaraderie, it was always friendship, and we always presented a united front. If something happens on set that we need to discuss, we all are going to say, ‘OK, we were thinking about this, and how can we shift, because maybe this isn’t working,’” she said.Johnson noted that “Harlem” is her first experience as a television series regular. “It was beautiful but also a little unfortunate to me that some of my castmates were like, ‘Jerrie, this isn’t how it is everywhere.’ We were having such a good time, and there was so much support, but I think we need to normalize this experience,” she continued. “We need to normalize the experience where Black women can work on a show together, have a good time, and truly and genuinely love each other.”Throughout the process of shooting the 10-episode first season, the four women worked closely with Oliver, who serves as the creator and showrunner, as well as the other writers and producers to ensure that certain lines were not “inauthentic to us as people or triggering to Black women,” Johnson said.“As a Black woman, watching Black women on TV — especially when the people behind the scenes aren’t Black women — can be a little triggering or jarring, because it feels like this isn’t a true reflection of my life or the life of many Black women that I know, and I can tell by just how one-dimensional this is that it wasn’t a Black woman who wrote this,” she added. “I think this will be a very liberating experience, and I’m so glad that it’s happening in Harlem, which is where I live now, because Harlem is so vibrant. It’s just thriving with Blackness, Black art — everything Black. I just think this show is definitely going to make a statement in more ways than one.”The first season of “Harlem” is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.Follow NBC Out on Twitter, Facebook & Instagram Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

Kavanaugh cites landmark gay rights cases in argument about abortion restrictions. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed to suggest earlier this week that landmark LGBTQ cases could support overturning federal abortion rights.The Supreme Court heard 90 minutes of oral arguments Wednesday concerning a Mississippi law that would ban almost all abortions in the state after 15 weeks of pregnancy.A majority of the court’s conservative justices appeared prepared to uphold the law and possibly overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision holding that women have a constitutional right to have an abortion before fetal viability, usually around 24 weeks.Supreme court signals willingness to uphold abortion limits in Mississippi caseDec. 2, 202101:50The crux of Wednesday’s oral arguments centered around whether the justices should preserve or walk back on precedent, a court decision that is considered authority for subsequent cases involving similar or identical circumstances. The court’s liberal justices warned that reversing a decades-old ruling would politicize the country’s highest court.However, citing two landmark gay rights cases — Lawrence v. Texas, which struck down state laws criminalizing consensual same-sex activity in 2003, and Obergefell v. Hodges, which resulted in the legalization of same-sex marriage across the United States in 2015 — Kavanaugh suggested that overruling the court’s previous opinions was standard procedure.“If you think about some of the most important cases, the most consequential cases in this court’s history, there’s a string of them where the cases overruled precedent,” Kavanaugh said. “If we think that the prior precedents are seriously wrong, if that, why then doesn’t the history of this court’s practice with respect to those cases tell us that the right answer is actually a return to the position of neutrality and — and not stick with those precedents in the same way that all those other cases didn’t?”The lawyers who argued in favor of gay rights in the landmark LGBTQ cases offered differing views on the validity of the argument by Kavanaugh, who was appointed in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump.Mary Bonauto, who argued on behalf of same-sex couples in Obergefell v. Hodges and now serves as the Civil Rights Project director at GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, or GLAD, challenged Kavanaugh’s analogy.“It’s a pretty thin interpretation of a reversal,” she told NBC News. “The reversals that Justice Kavanaugh is citing were about righting wrongs. They were centered on the rights of individuals and expanding constitutional protections to more individuals, not about taking rights away.”When the court ruled in favor of same-sex couples in Obergefell v. Hodges, it effectively overturned its prior decision in Baker v. Nelson. That ruling centered on Jack Baker and Mike McConnell, who in 1970 were blocked from obtaining a marriage license. The high court rejected the men's case in 1972 without ever hearing oral arguments. Bonauto argued against Kavanaugh’s comparison of reversing Baker v. Nelson to the potential reversal of Roe v. Wade.“There was no briefing, there was no argument. They just essentially utterly dismissed the case for basically: ‘There’s no way same-sex couples seeking to marry have claim under the Constitution.’ The end,” she said.LGBTQ advocates largely agreed with Bonauto, saying that the landmark gay rights decisions in Obergefell v. Hodges and Lawrence v. Texas “reflected the growing societal understanding of our common humanity.”“To that we say, NOT IN OUR NAME,” Sharon McGowan, legal director of the LGBTQ advocacy group Lambda Legal, said of Kavanaugh’s argument in a statement Wednesday. “Those landmark LGBTQ decisions EXPANDED individual liberty, not the opposite.”But Paul Smith, who argued in favor of LGBTQ rights in Lawrence v. Texas — which overruled the court’s 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick — suggested that Kavanaugh’s comparison was valid. Smith said that in order to win Lawrence v. Texas, he also had to bolster the argument for the court overriding precedent.RecommendedOUT NewsOUT NewsTransgender men describe 'nightmares' of being incarcerated in a women's prisonOUT Pop CultureOUT Pop Culture'Harlem' star says show expands the vision of what's possible for Black queer women“We really, actually made those arguments ourselves in Lawrence because that was the whole point — we had to get rid of Bowers v. Hardwick,” Smith, who is now a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, said. “It is certainly one of the most prominent examples of an overruling that’s happened in the last 20 years.”“People talk about stare decisis when they like the prior decision and not when they don’t,” Smith added, referring to the legal term for following what the court has ruled previously.But during the oral arguments, Justice Sonia Sotomayor raised the question of whether overruling Roe v. Wade could open the floodgates for the court’s 6-3 conservative majority to overrule a broad swath of previous opinions it does not agree with.“Why do we now say that somehow ... Roe and Casey are so unusual that they must be overturned?” Sotomayor said Wednesday, referring to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1992 opinion that affirmed Roe v. Wade.Later, during the oral arguments, Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart, who was defending the Mississippi abortion limits, to address Sotomayor’s assertion.Stewart said that several of the other cases Sotomayor cited, including the LGBTQ cases, produced “clear rules that have engendered strong reliance interests and that have not produced negative consequences,” in contrast to Roe v. Wade.But if the court does overrule the landmark abortion law, some legal experts warn that previous rulings, including the landmark LGBTQ decisions, would be in danger.“You can be sure that the Alliance Defending Freedom has the lawsuit ready to file the day after the Supreme Court issues an opinion broadly overruling Roe,” Katherine Franke, the director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School, said referring to a Christian law firm with a decadeslong track record of litigating against LGBTQ rights. “They will file the next day challenging Obergefell and even Lawrence. I have every confidence that that is what they’re to do.”The court is expected to decide on the Mississippi abortion law early next summer.Follow NBC Out on Twitter, Facebook & InstagramGet the Morning RundownGet a head start on the morning's top stories.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
 Queen Elizabeth and Barbados relationship change symbolizes a generational shift. More than five decades after declaring its independence from Britain, Barbados severed its colonial ties with the removal of Queen Elizabeth II as its head of state and swore in Sandra Mason as its president.In the same week, Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness announced that the country’s Constitution — which ascribes central, but largely indirect roles to the queen and her representative, the governor general — would be reviewed in 2022. Though Holness said the review is tied to wanting to address gaps that have been exposed during the Covid-19 pandemic, many speculated that this was Jamaica signaling, as it has done in the past, that it too is ready to cut ties with the British monarchy. As I watched the historic moment and spectacular ceremony in Barbados, I thought about how my late 93-year-old great-aunt, Kathleen, from Jamaica would not be in favor of what just happened in Barbados happening in Jamaica.My late 93-year-old great-aunt, Kathleen, from Jamaica would not be in favor of what just happened in Barbados happening in Jamaica.That may seem like a random thought to some, but the push by Barbados to distance itself from the royal family should be seen as a symbol of a generational shift. Younger leaders of color, especially given the struggles that Black people have endured in 2020 — which echoes all the way back for 400 years — will continue to push their countries out of the shadows of colonial rule, possibly against the wishes of an older West Indian generation.Aunt Kathleen was proud of her identity as a Jamaican and equally proud to be a citizen of the British Commonwealth. Such feelings are common among older generations. For them, the historic and contemporary links to the British Isles provided educational and career opportunities, and the occasional moments of besting Britain in the Commonwealth Games, or in test match cricket (where the West Indies teams of the 1970s and 1980s were among the best in the world).But perhaps what happened in Barbados this week — and what it might portend for other formerly colonized nations in the Caribbean and beyond — can serve as a template for how we progress as a society in the 21st centuryLike Jamaica, Barbados was part of the British Commonwealth, with an English settlement starting in the 1620s. Prince Charles, who attended the ceremony in Barbados, noted that “From the darkest days of our past and the appalling atrocity of slavery which forever stains our history, people of this island forged their path with extraordinary fortitude.”But many Americans, and I suspect people around the world, know little about the conditions of slavery in the Caribbean. The sugar and rum trade created some of the most brutal and inhumane conditions of chattel slavery — as well as the massive resistance on the part of enslaved Africans. In 1791, self-emancipated Africans started an insurrection in the island of Saint-Domingue (present day Haiti), which ended in 1804 with the declaration of independence in Haiti, the first successful rebellion of enslaved people in the Western Hemisphere.In the Barbados town of Bridgetown, there is a statue of the Igbo enslaved hero Bussa who led the largest rebellion in Barbadian history in 1816. Subsequent rebellions in Guyana in 1823 and Jamaica from 1831-1832 (from December to the following January) were landmark events that swayed public opinion about slavery in the British Empire. Slavery was abolished in 1833, with the Abolition of Slavery Act (though it didn’t take effect until 1834). From this point in history, colonial power in the Caribbean among the British, Dutch, French, Spanish and the United States has cast a long and indelible shadow among the nations in the region.Barbados' Prime Minister Mia Mottley, new President Sandra Mason, singer Rihanna, former cricketer Garfield Sobers and Britain's Prince Charles stand during the Presidential Inauguration Ceremony to mark the birth of a new republic in Barbados. Toby Melville / Pool via ReutersColonial power led to exploitation of the land, natural resources and people of the Caribbean. An odd symbiosis has developed between the inhabitants of these nations and the European colonial states. Many legal and constitutional influences are evident in the infrastructures of Caribbean nations; but it is also significant to note the intellectual, artistic and athletic influences on Europe. Yet these connections are fraught with complexities - racism, xenophobia, jingoism, colorism and classism.The Caribbean contributions to the economies, defense, and cultures of Europe are frequently overlooked, which has led to moments of reckoning. For this generation of Caribbean citizens, there is an open question about how to reconcile these underappreciated and undervalued investments that have been made — and whether or not to continue contributing.This speaks to the complex and confounding nature of these relationships. The example of Barbados presents one way of going forward. It was particularly powerful to have Charles, the heir to the British throne, discuss and acknowledge the systems of oppression subjected by his nation upon Barbadian people. Interestingly, at the same ceremony the Barbadian government awarded Charles the Order of Freedom, one of its highest national honors.Barbados is navigating an interesting path — retaining membership in the Commonwealth, honoring the British royal family and ending its colonial relationship.However in a nation that had protests in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and in memory of George Floyd, and which removed a statue of British Admiral Horatio Nelson, there are some who feel that independence was marred by the presence of royalty.Barbados is navigating an interesting path — retaining membership in the Commonwealth (a trade partnership with over 50 former British colonies), honoring the British royal family and ending its colonial relationship. These actions might seem contradictory and confusing, but it speaks to the intricacies of this relationship, one that has become even more complicated in the post-Brexit era. Some scholars question if a commonwealth’s relationship with post-Brexit Britain is even necessary when strengthening a relationship with the European Union, a top world economic power, would be more beneficial.Some scholars question if a commonwealth’s relationship with post-Brexit Britain is even necessary.Indeed, after the celebratory feelings subside, the new generation of leaders in Barbados (and other nations that are contemplating becoming a republic), will have several things to consider.And while Charles acknowledged the brutality of slavery, he did not apologize for it. It’s additionally unclear if his comments are an acknowledgment of governmental recognition of responsibility about Britain’s role in killing, maiming and otherwise thwarting the lives of Barbadians. So what comes next is an open question, and of great interest to those of us with familial ties to subjugated nations — but interestingly, those from the former colonial powers, also.RecommendedOpinionOpinionThe cruel beauty standards contradiction at the heart of online dating appsOpinionOpinionThe cynicism from Susan Collins on abortion rights is staggeringWill the Barbadian government, along with nations such as Trinidad and Tobago and Mauritius, the previous two nations to proclaim themselves as republics independent of Britain, in 1976 and 1992, respectively, force this moment of reckoning?RelatedOpinionOpinionWe want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor.And what does Barbados’ decision portend for the other nations in the Commonwealth realm? If a 2020 poll in Jamaica revealing that 55 percent of respondents supported removing Elizabeth as head of state is any indication, we could see more republics.Aunt Kathleen wouldn’t be pleased, but it appears the newer generations see their relationship with Europe differently. And that’s not a bad thing. In fact, perhaps this is not only a moment for the people of the Caribbean to rewrite their own story, but also a moment for a new generation of white Britons to learn from their country’s past atrocities.Subscribe to the THINK newsletterReTHINK the news cycle with timely op-eds, in-depth analyses and personal essays delivered weekly to your inbox.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

Cole Brown Stacey Abrams' Georgia governor bid shifted the center of the political universe. Stacey Abrams shifted the center of the political universe Wednesday when she announced her second bid for Georgia’s governorship. She will almost definitely be the Democratic nominee in a campaign that could prove historic – a win would make Abrams the first Black woman in the country to be elected governor and reaffirm Georgia’s leftward slide after turning blue in 2020.Of equal importance will be the race for the U.S. Senate, which Abrams’ efforts once helped secure. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., will seek re-election to the seat he won in January’s special election. The contest could decide the balance of the Senate in 2023.Georgia will be a major focus in the year to come.Both races assure that Georgia will be a major focus in the year to come. But Abrams’ recent bid for governor opens up room for another possibility that would’ve seemed inconceivable throughout most of the state’s history: Come Election Day, all four major party candidates for these races could be Black.The picture is clear on the Democratic side. Warnock and Abrams will be their party’s nominees. The Republican Senate primary is equally clear, as former NFL star Herschel Walker holds a commanding lead in polls with conservative voters. And in the governor’s race, Vernon Jones is challenging the Republican incumbent, Brian Kemp, in the primary, though Jones’ chances of success are uncertain.Taken together, these four candidacies embody the fraught nature of our current racial politics, and their campaigns imagine opposing visions for Blacks in American life.Want more articles like this? Follow THINK on Instagram to get updates on the week's most important cultural analysisWalker, who announced his run in August, is well known in the state for his Heisman-winning seasons with the University of Georgia. Republican voters appear unbothered by what, in another era, would’ve been heavy baggage. Walker has bragged about playing games of Russian roulette, and he’s long struggled with dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder. Most notably, he has a history of abuse allegations, including from his ex-wife, Claire Grossman, who in 2008 claimed that Walker held a gun to her temple “and said he was going to blow my brains out.” During a 2008 interview with CNN, Walker said he couldn’t remember the incident, but didn’t deny it.For Republican voters, a “complete and total endorsement” from former President Donald Trump seems to have papered over any concerns. The GOP establishment has come around as well; Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., labeled Walker “the only one who can unite the party, defeat Senator Warnock, and help us take back the Senate.”Jones, a far-right former state representative and Dekalb County executive, is vying for a Trump endorsement in the GOP primary for governor. After refusing to overturn the results of the lawful 2020 presidential election in his state, Kemp is in Trump’s crosshairs, which bodes well for Jones.If the conservative calls heralding a post-racial society have not begun yet, they will soon.Should former Sen. David Perdue, a supporter of Trump, enter the GOP race, he’d likely become the Trumpist candidate. But for now, Jones is a favored option for the hard-right, MAGA base seething for a Kemp exit.Four prominent contested seats. Three (possibly four) Black candidates to fill them. If the conservative calls heralding a post-racial society have not begun yet, they will soon. They’ll declare an America rid of its sins: “Georgia primaries prove racism a lib fantasy!” Or they’ll argue that the candidates’ shared heritage negates race as a factor in the contest altogether. As Debbie Dooley, the president of the Atlanta Tea Party, was cited as saying: Four Black candidates would force voters to choose based on “competing ideologies,” not race.Thank God for all this progress. And in Georgia no less, the unlikeliest of settings. A state affixed in the long shadow of Jim Crow and wrestled over in the modern-day fight for civil rights. In March, Kemp signed one of the most restrictive voting rights bills in the nation into law. Among its provisions was the near elimination of ballot drop boxes, strict I.D. requirements and limits on the window allotted to request absentee ballots, all of which will disproportionately affect Black voters.Democrat Stacey Abrams officially enters 2022 Georgia governor raceDec. 2, 202104:08Even symbolically, the Georgia races don’t offer hope of progress in our divisive climate. The array of viable Black candidates is a product of our hyper-racialized times, not a first step beyond them.For the Republicans’ part, Walker and Jones are candidates born of the party’s present need. Both trade in the same race-baiting and anti-democratic musings as their white colleagues. Walker, in a tweet in September 2020, described supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement as “marxist who want to destroy America ... in the disguise they care about black people & social justice.” Jones called BLM protesters in Atlanta “a bunch of ANTIFA affiliated thugs … [who] don’t give a damn about black lives.” Bernard Kerik, a Jones campaign adviser, proudly called his candidate a “Black Donald Trump.” Kerik is a former New York City Police Department commissioner who was pardoned by Trump after being sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to felony charges including tax fraud and lying to White House officials. Both Walker and Jones are all in on Trump’s baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election, particularly, in Georgia and the voter restrictions that have flown from them.Race is the foundation of both men’s appeal. For moderate Republicans, uneasy with years of far-right racial animus, Black Republican candidacies could be a welcomed reassurance. Why else would Walker have been paraded out during the 2020 Republican National Convention to proclaim that he’s “seen racism up close ... It isn’t Donald Trump.”RelatedOpinionOpinionWe want to hear what you THINK. Please submit a letter to the editor.Similarly, for Warnock and Abrams, race and its implications are the animating forces of their campaigns. They position themselves as the defenders of racial justice. Abrams has spent years combating voter suppression tactics in Georgia, including Kemp’s most recent bill, which, as she testified before Congress, had “components ... that are indeed racist.” Warnock, too, has met Republicans on the battlefield, labeling voter suppression tactics “Jim Crow in new clothes” and introducing the Preventing Election Subversion Act of 2021 to combat the worst of their effects.Taken together, these four candidates embody the state of our racial politics: warring factions, distrust and denial. They represent strikingly different visions for the role of Black citizenry in our Republic. Their candidacies, even symbolically, can’t inspire much hope.RecommendedOpinionOpinionThe cruel beauty standards contradiction at the heart of online dating appsOpinionOpinionThe cynicism from Susan Collins on abortion rights is staggeringThe hope will have to come from Georgia’s voters instead.Related:Georgia's 'Jim Crow' voter suppression bill is now lawRepublicans' voter suppression crusade may cost them corporate donorsGeorgia Senate election in 2021 reveals the need for a new 'Southern Strategy'Supreme Court's Arizona voting rights decision will affect challenges to Georgia's lawSubscribe to the THINK newsletterReTHINK the news cycle with timely op-eds, in-depth analyses and personal essays delivered weekly to your inbox.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Memphis official proposes  renaming street after slain rapper Young Dolph. A city council member will propose renaming a Memphis street in honor of slain hip-hop artist Young Dolph.  The announcement comes less than a month after the rapper, 36, was fatally shot inside a Memphis bakery, Makeda’s Homemade Butter Cookies on Nov. 12. Young Dolph, whose real name was Adolph Robert Thornton Jr., was a Memphis native who was visiting his hometown for a Thanksgiving turkey giveaway and other charity events. The Memphis Police Department has obtained surveillance video of the incident and is searching for two suspects. No arrests have been made, police said. JB Smiley, the city council member who proposed the renaming, said he plans to propose the measure on Tuesday and hopes it will offer a space for residents to grieve and celebrate the rapper’s legacy. Smiley said he expects the measure to gain the full support of the City Council. “It’s important for the city of Memphis to know that we’re going to celebrate our own,” Smiley told NBC BLK. “We need to tell the story that he was investing in young people in our community. He came back to Memphis to give back. … It’s only right for the city of Memphis to do right by him.” The rapper’s family said the street renaming — which will be in the South Memphis neighborhood where Young Dolph grew up — is a testament to his life.“Castalia Heights community, in particular, bestowing this honor is not only a way to celebrate his contributions, but it also continues to serve as a remembrance for the people of this community, of someone who made themselves a relatable example of hard work and perseverance,” the family said in a statement. “He sent the message that someone who went to the same schools as them, and walked the same streets that they do, was able to not only create a successful legacy for himself but also prioritize family and community. In short, he was a role model and beacon of hope. And he took this responsibility very seriously.” RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveSmiley plans to hold a public ceremony for the street renaming on Dec. 15. Follow NBCBLK on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Harvard adds caste bias protections for graduate student workers . Harvard University is the latest U.S. school to add measures protecting caste-oppressed students following a push from graduate workers and a national organization. Since March, South Asian graduate student organizers have tried to point out to the university's administration what they say is a real problem on campuses across the U.S.: discrimination based on the Hindu caste system. Those born into lower castes, known as Dalits in India's deeply rooted hierarchies, have faced violence and oppression on the subcontinent for thousands of years. Though the system is now illegal in India, its impact is still far-reaching and can manifest themselves in a lack of social and economic mobility. With the increase in South Asian immigration to the U.S. since the 1980s and '90s, the hierarchies have been carried overseas. Twenty-five percent of Dalits in the U.S. report having faced verbal or physical assault, according to research by Equality Labs, an organization dedicated to ending white supremacy and casteism. One in 3 Dalit students also reported experiencing prejudice that affected their education, the study found. Students trying to combat this on their campuses say they run into barriers in the process, particularly a sheer lack of knowledge among administrators.Aparna Gopalan, a South Indian doctoral student at Harvard and a member of the Graduate Student Union, has been part of negotiations since March to add more protected classes to the union’s contract. She says she found herself in board rooms filled with white administrators who had no foundational grasp of the caste system. “They had no idea what caste was,” Gopalan said. “I don’t think they really understood. At one point, they asked, ‘Why isn’t caste just protected under nationality?’ and I was flabbergasted. We were operating on a very basic level.”But after months of talks between the union and the administration, as well support from Equality Labs, the Graduate Student Union's contract was ratified this week and caste was added as the only new protected category.Harvard declined to comment other than confirming the contract has been ratified. Gopalan said that after the provision was approved, Dalit students began to come forward with their own experiences of discrimination, including by South Asian supervisors and instructors who would give their work less attention than that of upper caste students. Slurs and microaggressions from other students were also common. RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leave“We need for every student covered under this contract to be aware that this is even in there,” Gopalan said. “No one can come forward if they aren’t explicitly aware that this is protected.” Slurs are just the beginning of what Dalit students across the country have experienced on campus, said Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs. The longtime Dalit rights activist has advocated for young people facing sexual harassment, housing discrimination, diminished opportunities and physical assaults. "This important step recognizes first that we, too, exist at Harvard and that our experiences matter," said Raj Muthu, a Dalit Harvard alum and a member of Equality Labs' coalition. "As an alumni, I have certainly witnessed expressions of disdain and hostility directed towards members of oppressed castes, students and faculty."Dalits on campus might also feel like they don't belong in South Asian circles that are heavily pervaded with casteism or dominated by upper caste students. "Overall as a student from a caste-oppressed community, there is a deep sense of alienation and not belonging in South Asian settings," he said. "It’s a very isolating experience because as immigrants we try to seek refuge in our own ethnic communities."But progress may be on the horizon. Through Equality Labs, Soundararajan has supported student bodies as they push their administrations to protect the caste-oppressed among them. Harvard is only the latest to add a measure, with the University of California, Davis, and Colby College both taking similar steps in the last few months. “These aren’t overnight wins,” she said. “These are the results of many leaders going through the administrative process and building power toward caste equity.”She’s sure that there are more to come. “I see the change,” she said. “There hasn’t been a university that hasn’t wanted to do this.” After Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020, Soundararajan said schools became much more open to inclusive language. With high profile institutions beginning to adopt caste protection into official documents, she thinks others will soon follow suit. For Gopalan, Harvard’s new contract with the union is the beginning of change, not the end. “This is just the Grad Student Union,” she said. “We would like every union to have it at Harvard. We would like the university itself, outside of just workers, to put it in their handbooks.”Those affected by caste oppression know it’s a struggle that has long been invisible to non-South Asians in the U.S. Soundararajan hopes these university-level changes can be the first steps in a broader conversation. “It makes sure that our civil rights are being respected,” she said. Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Philly teenager, victim of brutal, racially-motivated train attack, speaks out. Christina Lu, a Philadelphia high school student who was one of the victims of a brutal, racially motivated attack earlier this month, spoke out for the first time Tuesday. The 18-year-old was with a group of students on a SEPTA train, Philadelphia’s public transit, when she saw a 14-year-old freshman, who is Asian, being attacked on his way home from school. When Lu tried to intervene, the group of attackers threw her to the ground and began kicking and beating her. Police say the assailants, four teenage girls, used racial slurs during the incident. Lu gave a speech to a crowd outside a municipal building Tuesday afternoon as a crowd rallied demanding accountability from SEPTA and an end to anti-Asian hate, according to a video from CBS Philly.“You all have inspired me,” she said. “Everyone has been calling me a hero, but I am not. I’m just an ordinary girl from an ordinary family who saw people in need of help and so I tried to help.”The four girls who allegedly perpetrated the attack, all under the age of 17, were charged with aggravated assault, ethnic intimidation, criminal conspiracy, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and disorderly conduct.The mother of one of the girls spoke to NBC10 Philadelphia anonymously, saying her daughter is 12 years old and had run away from home two weeks prior to the attack. “I was extremely hurt … I needed to meet with you guys publicly so that you know that my family is very sincerely apologetic about what happened to that child because we all pray that our children make it home safe from school,” she said.RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveShe said she tried to reach out to the families of the victims to apologize personally. A report released last year by the Stop AAPI Hate Youth Campaign revealed that one quarter of Asian American and Pacific Islander young adults have been targets of racism since the start of the pandemic.

Rapper Asian Doll facing backlash for hosting ‘Indian-themed’ party. The rapper Asian Doll is facing backlash on social media after announcing and selling tickets to her Indian-themed birthday party. The rapper, whose real name is Misharron Jermeisha Allen, grew up in Dallas and is not of South Asian descent. She announced the details of the party on her Twitter and Instagram on Sunday with a flyer set to Arabic background music. The party, called “Asian Doll Escapes to India,” will be held in Atlanta on Dec. 7. According to the online invitation, Indian clothes are required to enter. On her Instagram account, which has since been deactivated, she posted outfit inspiration pics that included Indian celebrities dressed in traditional kurtas and clips from Hindi movie dance numbers. The announcement gained traction, and eventually thousands of users began denouncing the party’s theme as blatant cultural appropriation. Some pointed to a now-deleted tweet Allen made in February in which she called Indian food “nasty.” “How is Asian Doll going to have a 'Indian' theme party which is so ignorant. But was just saying Indian food looked/tasted disgusting? Now I feel like the culture is a joke to her,” one person said. Others joked about her use of Arabic music to promote her “Bollywood” party, and some couldn’t help but laugh at how ridiculous and overt it all was. “LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL theme Bollywood music Arabic,” another person wrote. “[W]hy are some americans dense and this culturally unaware????”RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveThis isn’t the first time Allen has faced backlash for cultural appropriation, or the adoption or profiting from a minority culture. She’s known for pushing those boundaries, in fact. Those following the controversy were quick to note that even her stage name “Asian Doll” and her past use of traditional clothing were objectionable.Allen seemed to respond to the backlash on Twitter, saying that she doesn’t care what people say and that she’ll do what she wants “with no apologies.” She tweeted another announcement of the party on Monday morning, set to different music. Allen didn’t respond to NBC Asian America’s request for comment. Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Latinas in trucking are finding their place — in the driver's seats of 18-wheelers. Vanessa Rivas was the girl who found her dolls boring and liked trucks. So, as the coronavirus pandemic fed her anxieties about losing her auto financing job, she learned how to be a truck driver.There was plenty of time to study, because motor vehicle offices were closed by Covid-19. Convincing her parents was the bigger obstacle. Dad said "no," and Mom said "never." But Rivas, 34, of Los Angeles, went for it anyway."My dad had to understand it’s not a man’s world anymore when it comes to trucking," said Rivas, who is training to get her license.Just 6.6 percent of truck drivers are women, but Latinas are increasingly joining the overall workforce in other industries. They number about 12.5 million, about 16 percent of all working women, according to the Labor Department. While many people dispute claims that there’s a shortage of truck drivers, the jobs are billed as good opportunities for Latinas and other women. The reality is much more complicated in an industry in which high turnover is often attributed to poor wages and treatment.  Rivas is working her auto finance job while she continues trying to get her license to drive trucks.Alyson Aliano for NBC News"My dad had to understand it’s not a man’s world anymore when it comes to trucking," said Rivas, who is still training to get her license.Alyson Aliano for NBC NewsWhat might seem like a growth opportunity for someone working at the minimum wage in a service industry job actually comes with hidden costs and risks of assault and harassment. Making $80,000 a year or more is a strong draw, but higher salaries could mean longer hours and days away from family. It could also take years to reach that level of pay.The Latinas who spoke about their experiences said taking up trucking has brought them notable benefits along with challenges.“You can change your life and make great money at this job, and you are going to feel like you have a job with purpose,” said Desiree Wood, the president of Real Women in Trucking, which promotes safety, mentorship and industry transparency for women in trucking.But Wood warned that some companies claim that there is a driver shortage to bring in more women and minorities “who are desperate to get out of fast-food work or other kinds of work where they’re not really making a living wage.”  The unemployment rate for Latinas ages 20 and older at the end of October was 5.5 percent, with about 57.8 percent of all Latinas participating in the workforce, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Latinas’ median weekly earnings were $705 last year, putting them at the bottom of the earnings scale. Median weekly earnings for Asian men — at the top — were $1,447, the BLS reported.Congress is trying to give the industry a push in hiring more women. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which President Joe Biden signed Nov. 15, orders the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to create a volunteer advisory board to boost hiring and retention of women in trucking. In the meantime, Rivas is still working her auto finance job while she tries to get her license to drive trucks.  She said she has been told she can make $2,000 to $3,000 a week, depending on how many hours she's willing to work, and $3,000 to $4,000 if she drives out of state. "I didn't know that much money in one week can happen," she said.Skeptical parents, encouraging friendsLatinas who have entered the trucking industry say the new careers have meant better pay and that they have taken them from jobs they found unfulfilling and given them a sense of empowerment and accomplishment. Although some encountered resistance from spouses or other relatives, they said male friends, fellow students (who were overwhelmingly male) and significant others generally encouraged them to get into truck driving, joined them on the road or helped them with training."I didn't know that much money in one week can happen," Rivas said.Alyson Aliano for NBC News / Alyson Aliano for NBC NewsAs Covid lockdowns have eased, employment among Latinas is recovering faster than among Hispanic men, said Mónica García-Pérez, an economics professor at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota, who specializes in labor economics.So far, trucking isn’t attracting Latinas nationwide, but there may be regional increases in areas with concentrations of warehouses and distribution centers, García-Pérez said.Those re-entering the workforce appear to be filling jobs in fields that have been more male-dominated, such as packing and shipping, she said.Antoinette McIntosh, 42, was working as a financial adviser at an East Coast bank when the market crashed in 2008. Her job and her six-figure salary disappeared overnight. Antoinette McIntosh.Courtesy Antoinette McIntoshA good friend, Robert Montgomery, who later became her fiancé, told her to cash in on her love of driving and join him at his company as a truck driver. The company they worked for paid for her transportation to Salt Lake City and training in exchange for the couple’s working for the company for a year. “I’ve been in it ever since,” said McIntosh, who is Black and Puerto Rican and lives in the Cleveland, Mississippi, area. She has been a truck driver for 15 years.McIntosh's father also had been a truck driver, and her parents “did everything they could to keep me out of a truck,” she said. Trying to fulfill their wishes, she went to college, double-majored in psychology and social work and “made everyone else happy.” McIntosh now makes more than she did at her bank job, she said.“What a lot of people don’t tell you is this pays you better than a white-collar job in a lot of businesses, so it’s not so much of a stigma anymore,” McIntosh said.Shifting in the pandemicRosio Villagrana, 35, got her Class A truck driver’s license on July 30. The company that hired her told her it hadn’t had a female truck driver for several years, she said.She had worked in and managed a pawn shop for about a decade. But her friends' work driving semi-trailer trucks had long intrigued her. With time on her hands and feeling restless confined to work and home early in the pandemic, Villagrana decided to give truck driving a try.“Why not?” she recalled saying. “I’m so for women empowerment. I feel like we are capable of what we do, plus more, especially in this male-dominated industry.”Ultimately, her goal is to be an owner-operator and one day own her own fleet of trucks. Tracy Barajas, 27, of Corona, California, has been driving trucks for three years. She had worked in online fashion stores and as a dispatcher for a plumbing company.Tracy Barajas of Corona, Calif., has been driving trucks for three years. Courtesy Tracy BarajasHer boyfriend, Oscar Hernandez, and cousins, who were truck drivers, inspired her to make the jump into trucking, she said.Barajas said she had lived paycheck to paycheck before she got into trucking. She had briefly attended community college with plans to be a psychologist. In trucking, she and Hernandez, who drive as a team and log their journeys online, have individually saved tens of thousands of dollars, and she makes four times her previous income, she said.“I never in my head would have thought that I would be able to or I would be in truck driving,” Barajas said. Steering through sexism, danger and scamsAll of the positive accounts notwithstanding, trucking can be a dangerous profession, and it can affect marriages and families. Not everyone experiences a financial windfall.McIntosh said her marriage ended over trucking. Her spouse at the time she started didn’t want her driving trucks. RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveShe also lost money when she leased a truck from her employer. Costs for maintenance, gasoline, inspection and registration tags, insurance and other expenses were deducted from her paycheck, McIntosh said. She was falling short even when she increased her workload.McIntosh ended up joining a class-action lawsuit against the company, which settled with her and other drivers over the leasing arrangement.McIntosh used to travel with her fiancé, Montgomery. On a trip in Wisconsin in June, he suffered a massive heart attack while they were in their truck cab. He died in her arms, she said.She continues to drive, in part, to keep a promise to help support his brother who has autism, she said. Barajas was rear-ended by a drunk driver while she was driving a truck in Colorado in February 2020. Soon after the accident, her company reduced her and her boyfriend's wages by 10 cents and terminated their benefits, including their health care plan and their 401(k) retirement benefits. Barajas and her boyfriend switched to driving for FedEx in May 2020 and are making a good living again.Wood, of Real Women in Trucking, said that as more Latinas start driving trucks, there is a need for caution. Women are often paired with male drivers they don’t know for training, and that’s where “a lot of women fall through the cracks," she said. Some are raped or harassed and then retaliated against when they report the incidents, she said.The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has been studying harassment and assaults of women and minority truckers.None of the Latinas who were interviewed said they had experienced any physical sexual harassment or assaults. Barajas said she gets hateful and sexist comments on her YouTube page for being a woman who drives a truck. But the comments that stick with her are from women who say she inspires them, she said. Student drivers also can be exploited because they work for low wages while they are in training, Wood said. She warns women not to enter company-sponsored training, although the women interviewed for this article said they had good experiences. The American Trucking Association, the trade and lobbying group for major trucking employers, reported that the annualized turnover rate for truck drivers last year was 90 percent, a point less than it was in 2019. For smaller fleets, it was 69 percent, down from 72 percent. A lot of the turnover happens in truckers’ first year, Wood said. Rivas said she has been told she can make $2,000 to $3,000 a week depending on how many hours she's willing to work and $3,000 to $4,000 if she drives out of state. Alyson Aliano for NBC NewsMany companies pay drivers based on how many miles they drive. The rate per mile can vary by experience. Drivers also might not drive enough miles to earn the money they thought they’d make.In May 2020, median pay for heavy and tractor-trailer truck drivers was $47,130 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That means half of such drivers made more and half made less.Ellen Voie, the president of Women in Trucking, said private fleets have lower turnover. Walmart has said that its average annual pay for its drivers is about $87,500 and that they earn training pay and pay when they aren’t driving. Voie said the biggest predictor of turnover is whether drivers feel misled about what they were promised. “​​The carriers who can match that reality with what they’re promising the driver will keep the drivers, but the ones who oversell or don’t live up to what they’re selling are the ones where the drivers get discouraged and leave,” Voie said.  Voie advised women to ask questions, such as whether a truck driving school is credible and will hold proper trainings and which carriers "walk the walk." She advised asking whether carriers give drivers the promised miles, what kind of time at home they provide and what pay raises and safety bonuses they offer. McIntosh advises Latinas getting into trucking to learn the industry first, drive for a company, increase their savings, pay off bills at home and be diligent about understanding the costs associated with leasing trucks. The women acknowledge that there are pitfalls and barriers to consider, which may dissuade others from following them into the industry. But Barajas said the small number of women in the field shouldn’t be one of those reasons.“Who cares if it is a male-dominated industry?” she said. “I would say just take the leap.

An 'eye' for trash? This Latino artist is a hit during Art Basel. Cycling around the streets of Miami gave David Anasagasti, an artist known as Ahol Sniffs Glue, the inspiration to place his signature "eye" symbol on pieces of urban trash he finds and give his followers a chance to find them and keep them.His newest concept is now drawing international attention through an exhibition during Miami Art Week that runs parallel to Art Basel. Art Basel, the country's contemporary art fair that runs through this week in Miami Beach attracts high net-worth individuals from around the world and includes works of artists such as Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat.It's not Anasagasti's first time exhibiting during Miami Art Week, but the concept of featuring trash converted to art contrasts with the opulence of Art Basel. Anasagasti, 41, began his career over 20 years ago with street art and graffiti culture. A couple of years later, he began creating paintings and drawings. His art has sold for as much as $80,000 for a piece. The Cuban American artist had a rough upbringing in the working-class suburb of Hialeah. He and his older brother were raised by his grandparents while his mother worked late-night shifts to make ends meet — his dad was out of the picture. The brothers relied on hand-me-down clothes and spent much of their time sitting around the television watching MTV."Life is harsh. I learned that at an early age, " he told NBC News in a phone interview. "I knew that survival was crucial. I knew that the only safety net that I have under me was that one that I put under myself."Shortly after graduating as an AP honors student from South Ridge Senior High School in Miami, he dealt with the emotional toll of his mother's breast cancer diagnosis.  RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leave"Me and my brother would take turns taking my mom to chemo after work," Anasagasti said. "You go from not having to pay rent [to]  all of sudden, like, a survivor for yourself."For almost a decade, Anasagasti would help organize parties in downtown Miami as a side gig to his regular, 40-hour-a-week job. Using his cellphone and an app similar to PhotoShop, he would create mashup images to promote the parties. After the pandemic, he said, he decided to leave his old life of partying and drugs behind, focusing on his passion for painting. 'Can't get arrested for painting on trash'Inspired by his bike rides across the city, he began painting on trash using his signature "eye" stamp while uploading pictures on Instagram, amassing more than 39,000 followers. It was a way to "interact with the city and keep it more fun," he said."I can't get arrested for painting on trash. So let me just incentivize people," said Anasagasti, whose work has become a scavenger hunt for his followers. He posts images on his Instagram story and other social media accounts with a present icon, those who find the art first are able to keep it. "We're being united by these trash items."In collaboration with Florida International University's Ratcliffe Art + Design Incubator and the Wolfsonian Public Humanities Lab, Anasagasti's exhibition "Geographies of Trash: Art Cycling with Ahol Sniffs Glue" has become a hit during Art Basel. Along with the exhibition, participants of Art Basel’s first trash-to-art scavenger hunt scored NFTs of Anasagasti’s work. "If I would have known that I was going to take it this far, I would have never named myself Ahol," said Anasagasti, whose pricey artwork is now a coveted collector's item. "I am showing that as long as you're leading from the gut, and you're shooting from the heart, I feel that I'm just living as honest as I can."Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
'Spirit of resistance': Marking 500 years since the first slave revolt in the Americas. Five hundred years ago this month, the Americas saw its first revolt of enslaved people, when Black Africans rose up against colonial powers in the Caribbean.Historians believe the Santo Domingo Slave Revolt took place on Dec. 26, 1521, starting at a sugar plantation owned by Diego Columbus, son of Christopher Columbus.  He was governor of La Española, the present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti, according to a monograph on the revolt published by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute (DSI) at the City College of New York.  The enslaved people marched 62 miles from the plantation to a village in an attempt to reach other Black Africans seeking freedom. The uprising was strategically planned during the Christmas season, because the enslaved knew that the white Spaniards would be distracted and deep in prayer, according to the monograph. “This was so well planned, which is also very interesting to me as a sociologist, that they came from different places in Africa," said scholar Ramona Hernandez, director of CUNY DSI and a professor of sociology at City College. "So they spoke different languages yet they found ways of putting together an insurrection."“It reveals this spirit of resistance, and not taking on oppression passively," Hernandez said.The Spanish soon sent in military reinforcements that effectively halted the revolt. But the legacy of the rebellion, which is considered the first recorded revolt in the Americas, reverberated throughout the region. Slaves try to overcome their Spanish owners but are captured and hanged from trees in 1595. Theodor de Bry / Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThe start of 'Black Codes'The year after the revolt, La Española introduced laws targeting Black people that were set in place to restrict the rights and movements of any person who was Black, whether they were free or not. This was one of the first versions of “Black Codes” seen in the Americas, according to Hernandez. “These are the first laws that are going to tell masters and others that were a part of the power structure in La Española how the black enslaved people are going to be treated,” Hernandez said.She noted that many enslaved people did manage to escape after  arriving on the island in the late 1400s. But the Santo Domingo Revolt was the first time Black Africans were combating authorities head-on, which led to strict and punitive treatment. RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveOverall, there is a lot that is still unknown about how the enslaved people of La Española managed to attempt such a bold insurrection. To further the conversation and unpack the significance of this history, CUNY DSI and the Black Studies Program at City College is hosting a two-day conference titled “The Struggle for Freedom in La Española.” In collaboration with nearly 13 other schools and institutions, including the Eduardo León Jiménes Cultural Center in the Dominican Republic, the multidisciplinary conference looks at how this uprising confronted the Spanish colonials and defied the status quo. “We need to commemorate this, that this happened 500 years ago, that the civil rights movement that we saw here [in the U.S.] was simply a continuation of something that our ancestors have done, so that our people continue to think that it is their job to combat what is evil in humanity," Hernandez said.Although the conference is set to engage well-known scholars and voices on the subject, Hernandez expects to tap younger generations who can benefit from understanding and exploring the history of liberation in the Americas. “Any action that one of our people have taken anywhere, anytime to undermine what has been done to us, we need to remember it," said Hernandez, "and we need to acknowledge it so that the younger generation doesn't forget."Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
Trump's border separations left children, parents with severe trauma, study finds. Children and parents separated at the border under the Trump administration experienced severe psychological trauma that some are dealing with long after being reunited, the first qualitative study of children and parents has found.The study by Physicians for Human Rights published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal PLOS ONE concluded that the separation of 31 parents and children whose cases the group reviewed “constitutes cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment” and that the cases “rise to the level of torture” as defined by the United Nations Convention Against Torture.“In the cases reviewed, it is apparent that U.S. officials intentionally carried out actions causing severe pain and suffering in order to punish and intimidate mainly Central American asylum seekers to not pursue their asylum claims,” the study stated.Then-President Donald Trump’s "zero tolerance" policy, which separated thousands of children from their parents, was fully implemented in May 2018. Under the policy, the U.S. government took children from parents, not all who had crossed illegally, at the border and prosecuted the adults. Some parents were deported without their children.Facing heavy backlash, Trump signed an executive order reversing the policy about a month later. Clinicians who interviewed and evaluated the families reported that most of the individuals met diagnostic criteria for at least one mental health condition such as post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.Children exhibited behaviors described as age-appropriate regression, such as crying, not eating, having nightmares, sleeping difficulties, excessive parental attachment, clinging to caregivers, urinary incontinence and recurring feelings of fear after being reunited with parents.Two children who had long been reunited with parents still showed severe trauma symptoms and met mental health disorder criteria, the researchers said.One was a 6-year-old Guatemalan girl who met criteria for PTSD a year after being reunited with parents. An 8-year-old boy met criteria for PTSD and separation anxiety two years after reunification.“Neither had exhibited these symptoms prior to the separation event,” the researchers stated.All parents in the study arrived at the border having already suffered significant trauma because of targeted violence in their home countries.In almost all cases, the children had also experienced harm, including being drugged, kidnapped, poisoned and threatened with death or bodily harm by gang members.“Parents were confident that the journey to the United States would ensure protection for their children,” the study said.But parents and children told the researchers that U.S. officials treated them punitively. They said immigration officials forcibly removed their children from their arms and transferred parents to other facilities as they slept.Almost all told the researchers the officials would not tell them why they were being separated, where their family member was sent and whether or how they’d be reunited.RecommendedU.S. newsU.S. newsChris Cuomo denies allegation of sexual misconduct after being fired from CNNU.S. newsU.S. newsSan Francisco restaurant hit with negative reviews after asking officers to leaveParents said they were mocked when they asked about their children.Three of the 19 parents exhibited suicidal thoughts.Clinicians who interviewed parents and children found no signs that the immigrants were exaggerating their mental health trauma or were trying to deceive others, as some immigration restrictionists have asserted, the study said."Physicians for Human Rights has long documented the detrimental effects of forced family separation on asylum seekers, and the findings of this study provide additional medical evidence that the psychological trauma could potentially be lifelong," Kathryn Hampton, deputy director of PHR's asylum program, said in a news release.The researchers found that in almost every case, therapy, removal from detention and prescription of psychiatric medicines was needed.The study is based on an analysis of affidavits from clinicians’ interviews and evaluations of children and parents. The affidavits from the interviews are used for legal cases, including asylum claims and lawsuits for damages caused by family separation.The study builds on the warnings and findings by pediatricians, mental health experts and government watchdogs.The decision to separate children from parents was agreed on by a show of hands in a meeting of Trump senior advisers led by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, NBC News previously reported.The White House said last month that more than 1,000 families   separated at the border had not yet been reunited.President Joe Biden has expressed support for compensating separated families, some of whom are seeking damages from the government. The Trump White House killed a deal for mental health care for separated families, NBC News reported last year."It is our moral imperative to not only reunite these families, but to provide them with the support and services they need to heal," said Liza Acevedo, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. She said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has heard firsthand from parents about their pain and trauma "after being cruelly separated under the previous administration's zero-tolerance policy."Hampton said the study's findings should be considered as the administration negotiates settlements. But she also said the administration should widen its focus as it determined a dollar amount. Researchers recommended the government include mental health support for the parents and children who were separated. They also urged changes in how immigration authorities question them, including allowing children to remain with parents during asylum interviews or allowing them to take breaks to see their children. The Biden administration's task force created a website to assist families with reunification. A lawsuit has made some reunited families  eligible for behavioral health services. HHS and the task force also offering screenings and treatment for behavioral health conditions caused by the separations, Acevedo said.  The task force also is identifying funding for ongoing treatment and future services for the families, she said.Follow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.Get the Evening RundownA rundown of the day's top stories and headlines.Sign UpThis site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service
